1 Overview
**********

The Modus themes are designed for accessible readability.  They conform
with the highest standard for color contrast between any given
combination of background and foreground values.  This corresponds to
the WCAG AAA standard, which specifies a minimum rate of distance in
relative luminance of 7:1.

   Modus Operandi (‘modus-operandi’) is a light theme, while Modus
Vivendi (‘modus-vivendi’) is dark.  Each theme’s color palette is
designed to meet the needs of the numerous interfaces that are possible
in the Emacs computing environment.

   The overarching objective of this project is to always offer
accessible color combinations.  There shall never be a compromise on
this principle.  If there arises an inescapable trade-off between
readability and stylistic considerations, we will always opt for the
former.

   To ensure that users have a consistently accessible experience, the
themes strive to achieve as close to full face coverage as possible
(*note Face coverage::).

   Furthermore, the themes are designed to empower users with red-green
color deficiency (deuteranopia).  This is achieved in three ways:

  1. The conformance with the highest legibility standard means that
     text is always readable no matter the perception of its hue.

  2. Most contexts use colors on the blue-cyan-magenta-purple side of
     the spectrum.  Put differently, green and/or red are seldom used,
     thus minimizing the potential for confusion.

     *note Why are colors mostly variants of blue, magenta, cyan?: Why
     are colors mostly variants of blue magenta cyan?.

  3. In contexts where a red/green color-coding is unavoidable, we
     provide a universal toggle to customize the themes so that a
     red/blue scheme is used instead.

     *note Option for red-green color deficiency or deuteranopia:
     Deuteranopia style.

   Starting with version 0.12.0 and onwards, the themes are built into
GNU Emacs.

1.1 How do the themes look like
===============================

Check the web page with the screen shots
(https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes-pictures/).  There are lots
of scenarios on display that draw attention to details and important
aspects in the design of the themes.  They also showcase the numerous
customization options.

2 Installation
**************

The Modus themes are distributed with Emacs starting with version 28.1.
On older versions of Emacs, they can be installed using Emacs’ package
manager or manually from their code repository.  There also exist
packages for distributions of GNU/Linux.

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install manually from source,  Next: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.1 Install manually from source
================================

In the following example, we are assuming that your Emacs files are
stored in ‘~/.emacs.d’ and that you want to place the Modus themes in
‘~/.emacs.d/modus-themes’.

  1. Get the source and store it in the desired path by running the
     following in the command line shell:

     $ git clone https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes.git ~/.emacs.d/modus-themes

  1. Add that path to your known Elisp libraries’ list, by placing this
     snippet of Emacs Lisp in your init file (e.g.  ‘init.el’):

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/modus-themes")

   The themes are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install from the archives,  Next: Install on GNU/Linux,  Prev: Install manually from source,  Up: Installation

2.2 Install from the archives
=============================

The ‘modus-themes’ package is available from the GNU ELPA archive, which
is configured by default.

   Prior to querying any package archive, make sure to update the index,
with ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’.  Then all you need to do is type
‘M-x package-install’ and specify the ‘modus-themes’.

   Once installed, the themes are ready to be used: *note Enable and
load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install on GNU/Linux,  Next: Dealing with byte compilation errors,  Prev: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.3 Install on GNU/Linux
========================

The themes are also available from the archives of some distributions of
GNU/Linux.  These should correspond to a tagged release rather than
building directly from the latest Git commit.  It all depends on the
distro’s packaging policies.

* Menu:

* Debian 11 Bullseye::
* GNU Guix::


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Debian 11 Bullseye,  Next: GNU Guix,  Up: Install on GNU/Linux

2.3.1 Debian 11 Bullseye
------------------------

The themes are part of Debian 11 Bullseye.  Get them with:

     sudo apt install elpa-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.

   NOTE that Debian’s package is severely out-of-date as of this writing
2022-07-24 09:57 +0300.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: GNU Guix,  Prev: Debian 11 Bullseye,  Up: Install on GNU/Linux

2.3.2 GNU Guix
--------------

Users of Guix can get the themes with this command:

     guix package -i emacs-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Dealing with byte compilation errors,  Prev: Install on GNU/Linux,  Up: Installation

2.4 Dealing with byte compilation errors
========================================

From time to time, we receive bug reports pertaining to errors with byte
compilation.  These seldom have to do with faulty code in the themes: it
might be a shortcoming of ‘package.el’, some regression in the current
development target of Emacs, a misconfiguration in an otherwise exotic
setup, and the like.

   The common solution with a stable version of Emacs is to:

  1. Delete the ‘modus-themes’ package.
  2. Close the current Emacs session.
  3. Install the ‘modus-themes’ again.

   For those building Emacs directly from source, the solution may
involve reverting to an earlier commit in emacs.git.

   At any rate, if you encounter such an issue please report it: we will
either fix the bug on our end if it is truly ours, or help forward it to
the relevant upstream maintainer.  Whatever you do, please understand
that a build failure does not mean we are necessarily doing something
wrong.

   *note Issues you can help with::.

3 Enable and load
*****************

Users of the built-in themes cannot ‘require’ the package as usual
because there is no package to speak of.  Instead, things are simpler as
all one needs is to load the theme of their preference by adding either
form to their init file:

     (load-theme 'modus-operandi)            ; Light theme
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)             ; Dark theme

   Users of packaged variants of the themes must add a few more lines to
ensure that everything works as intended.  First, one has to require the
main library before loading either theme:

     (require 'modus-themes)

   Then it is recommended to load the individual theme files with the
helper function ‘modus-themes-load-themes’:

     ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme (else you get an error).
     (modus-themes-load-themes)

   Once the libraries that define the themes are enabled, one can
activate a theme with either of the following expressions:

     (modus-themes-load-operandi)            ; Light theme
     ;; OR
     (modus-themes-load-vivendi)             ; Dark theme

   Changes to the available customization options must always be
evaluated before loading a theme (*note Customization Options::).  An
exception to this norm is when using the various Custom interfaces or
with commands like ‘M-x customize-set-variable’, which can optionally
automatically reload the theme (*note Option for inhibiting theme
reload: Custom reload theme.).

   This is how a basic setup could look like:

     ;;; For the built-in themes which cannot use `require':
     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
           modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))

     ;; Load the theme of your choice:
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi) ;; OR (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)



     ;;; For packaged versions which must use `require':
     (require 'modus-themes)

     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
           modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))

     ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme
     (modus-themes-load-themes)

     ;; Load the theme of your choice:
     (modus-themes-load-operandi) ;; OR (modus-themes-load-vivendi)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)

   *note Sample configuration with and without use-package::.

   With those granted, bear in mind a couple of technical points on
‘modus-themes-load-operandi’ and ‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’, as well as
‘modus-themes-toggle’ which relies on them:

  1. Those functions call ‘load-theme’.  Some users prefer to opt for
     ‘enable-theme’ instead (*note Differences between loading and
     enabling::).

  2. The functions will run the ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’ as
     their final step.  This can be employed for bespoke configurations
     (*note Advanced customization::).  Experienced users may not wish
     to rely on such a hook and the functions that run it: they may
     prefer a custom solution (*note A theme-agnostic hook for theme
     loading::).

3.1 Sample configuration with and without use-package
=====================================================

It is common for Emacs users to rely on ‘use-package’ for declaring
package configurations in their setup.  We use this as an example:

     ;;; For the built-in themes which cannot use `require':
     (use-package emacs
       :init
       ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
       (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
             modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
             modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))
       :config
       ;; Load the theme of your choice:
       (load-theme 'modus-operandi) ;; OR (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)
       :bind ("<f5>" . modus-themes-toggle))



     ;;; For packaged versions which must use `require':
     (use-package modus-themes
       :ensure
       :init
       ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
       (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
             modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
             modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))

       ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme
       (modus-themes-load-themes)
       :config
       ;; Load the theme of your choice:
       (modus-themes-load-operandi) ;; OR (modus-themes-load-vivendi)
       :bind ("<f5>" . modus-themes-toggle))

   The same without ‘use-package’:

     ;;; For the built-in themes which cannot use `require':
     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
           modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))

     ;; Load the theme of your choice:
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi) ;; OR (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)



     ;;; For packaged versions which must use `require':
     (require 'modus-themes)

     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
           modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))

     ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme
     (modus-themes-load-themes)

     ;; Load the theme of your choice:
     (modus-themes-load-operandi) ;; OR (modus-themes-load-vivendi)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)

   *note Differences between loading and enabling::.

   Note: make sure not to customize the variable
‘custom-theme-load-path’ or ‘custom-theme-directory’ after the themes’
package declaration.  That will lead to failures in loading the files.
If either or both of those variables need to be changed, their values
should be defined before the package declaration of the themes.

3.2 Differences between loading and enabling
============================================

The reason we recommend ‘load-theme’ instead of the other option of
‘enable-theme’ is that the former does a kind of “reset” on the face
specs.  It quite literally loads (or reloads) the theme.  Whereas the
latter simply puts an already loaded theme at the top of the list of
enabled items, re-using whatever state was last loaded.

   As such, ‘load-theme’ reads all customizations that may happen during
any given Emacs session: even after the initial setup of a theme.
Examples are calls to ‘custom-set-faces’, as well as new values assigned
to the options the Modus themes provide (*note Customization Options::).

   Our tests show that ‘enable-theme’ does not read such variables anew,
so it might appear to the unsuspecting user that the themes are somehow
broken whenever they try to assign a new value to a customization option
or some face.

   This “reset” that ‘load-theme’ brings about does, however, come at
the cost of being somewhat slower than ‘enable-theme’.  Users who have a
stable setup and who seldom update their variables during a given Emacs
session, are better off using something like this:

     (require 'modus-themes)
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi t t)
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t t)

     (enable-theme 'modus-operandi) ;; OR (enable-theme 'modus-vivendi)

   *note Toggle themes without reloading them::.

   *note Sample configuration with and without use-package::.

   With the above granted, other sections of the manual discuss how to
configure custom faces, where ‘load-theme’ is expected, though
‘enable-theme’ could still apply in stable setups:

   *note Case-by-case face specs using the themes' palette::.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

4 Customization Options
***********************

The Modus themes are highly configurable, though they should work well
without any further tweaks.  By default, all customization options are
set to nil, unless otherwise noted in this manual.

   Remember that all customization options must be evaluated before
loading a theme (*note Enable and load::).  If the theme is already
active, it must be reloaded for changes in user options to come into
force.

   Below is a summary of what you will learn in the subsequent sections
of this manual.

4.1 Option for inhibiting theme reload
======================================

Brief: Toggle reloading of the active theme when an option is changed
through the Customize UI.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-inhibit-reload’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’
  2. ‘t’ (default)

   By default, customizing a theme-related user option through the
Custom interfaces or with ‘M-x customize-set-variable’ will not reload
the currently active Modus theme.

   Enable this behaviour by setting this variable to ‘nil’.

   Regardless of this option, the active theme must be reloaded for
changes to user options to take effect (*note Enable and load::).

4.2 Option for red-green color deficiency or deuteranopia
=========================================================

Brief: When non-nil use red/blue color-coding instead of red/green,
where appropriate.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-deuteranopia’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   This is to account for red-green color deficiency, also know as
deuteranopia and variants.  It applies to all contexts where there can
be a color-coded distinction between failure or success, a to-do or done
state, a mark for deletion versus a mark for selection (e.g.  in Dired),
current and lazily highlighted search matches, removed lines in diffs as
opposed to added ones, and so on.

   Note that this does not change all colors throughout the active
theme, but only applies to cases that have color-coding significance.
For example, regular code syntax highlighting is not affected.  There is
no such need because of the themes’ overarching commitment to the
highest legibility standard, which ensures that text is readable
regardless of hue, as well as the predominance of colors on the
blue-cyan-magenta-purple side of the spectrum.

   *note Why are colors mostly variants of blue, magenta, cyan?: Why are
colors mostly variants of blue magenta cyan?.

4.3 Option for more bold constructs
===================================

Brief: Use bold for code syntax highlighting and related.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-bold-constructs’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to use a bold typographic weight only when it is
required.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) display several syntactic constructs in
bold weight.  This concerns keywords and other important aspects of code
syntax.  It also affects certain mode line indicators and command-line
prompts.

   Advanced users may also want to configure the exact attributes of the
‘bold’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

4.4 Option for more italic constructs
=====================================

Brief: Use italics for code syntax highlighting and related.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-italic-constructs’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to not use slanted text forms (italics) unless it is
absolutely necessary.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) choose to render more faces in italics.
This typically affects documentation strings and code comments.

   Advanced users may also want to configure the exact attributes of the
‘italic’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Syntax styles,  Next: Mixed fonts,  Prev: Italic constructs,  Up: Customization Options

4.5 Option for syntax highlighting
==================================

Brief: Set the overall style of code syntax highlighting.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-syntax’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘faint’
   • ‘yellow-comments’
   • ‘green-strings’
   • ‘alt-syntax’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) is to use a balanced
combination of colors on the cyan-blue-magenta side of the spectrum.
There is little to no use of greens, yellows, and reds.  Comments are
gray, strings are blue colored, doc strings are a shade of cyan, while
color combinations are designed to avoid exaggerations.

   The property ‘faint’ fades the saturation of all applicable colors,
where that is possible or appropriate.

   The property ‘yellow-comments’ applies a yellow color to comments.

   The property ‘green-strings’ applies a green color to strings and a
green tint to doc strings.

   The property ‘alt-syntax’ changes the combination of colors beyond
strings and comments, so that the effective palette is broadened to
provide greater variety relative to the default.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (faint)
     (green-strings yellow-comments)
     (alt-syntax green-strings yellow-comments)
     (faint alt-syntax green-strings yellow-comments)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-syntax '(faint alt-syntax))

   Independent of this variable, users may also control the use of a
bold weight or italic text: ‘modus-themes-bold-constructs’ and
‘modus-themes-italic-constructs’.

4.6 Option for font mixing
==========================

Brief: Toggle the use of monospaced fonts for spacing-sensitive
constructs (affects font families).

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mixed-fonts’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   When set to non-nil (‘t’), configure some spacing-sensitive faces
like Org tables and code blocks to always inherit from the ‘fixed-pitch’
face.  This is to ensure that certain constructs like code blocks and
tables remain monospaced even when users opt for a mode that remaps
typeface families, such as the built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’.
Otherwise the layout would appear broken, due to how spacing is done.

   For a consistent experience, user may need to specify the font family
of the ‘fixed-pitch’ face.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.

   Furthermore, users may prefer to use another package for handling
mixed typeface configurations, rather than letting the theme do it,
perhaps because a purpose-specific package has extra functionality.  Two
possible options are ‘org-variable-pitch’ and ‘mixed-pitch’.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Link styles,  Next: Box buttons,  Prev: Mixed fonts,  Up: Customization Options

4.7 Option for links
====================

Brief: Control the style of links to web pages, files, buffers...

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-links’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • Underline style:
        • ‘neutral-underline’
        • ‘no-underline’
   • Text coloration:
        • ‘faint’
        • ‘no-color’
   • ‘bold’
   • ‘italic’
   • ‘background’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) is a prominent text
color, typically blue, with an underline of the same color.

   For the style of the underline, a ‘neutral-underline’ property turns
the color of the line into a subtle gray, while the ‘no-underline’
property removes the line altogether.  If both of those are set, the
latter takes precedence.

   For text coloration, a ‘faint’ property desaturates the color of the
text and the underline, unless the underline is affected by the
aforementioned properties.  While a ‘no-color’ property removes the
color from the text.  If both of those are set, the latter takes
precedence.

   A ‘bold’ property applies a heavy typographic weight to the text of
the link.

   An ‘italic’ property adds a slant to the link’s text (italic or
oblique forms, depending on the typeface).

   A ‘background’ property applies a subtle tinted background color.

   In case both ‘no-underline’ and ‘no-color’ are set, then a subtle
gray background is applied to all links.  This can still be combined
with the ‘bold’ and ‘italic’ properties.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (faint)
     (no-underline faint)
     (no-color no-underline bold)
     (italic bold background no-color no-underline)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-links '(neutral-underline background))

   The placement of the underline, meaning its proximity to the text, is
controlled by ‘x-use-underline-position-properties’,
‘x-underline-at-descent-line’, ‘underline-minimum-offset’.  Please refer
to their documentation strings.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Box buttons,  Next: Command prompts,  Prev: Link styles,  Up: Customization Options

4.8 Option for box buttons
==========================

Brief: Control the style of buttons in the Custom UI and related.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-box-buttons’ (‘choice’ type, list of
properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘flat’
   • ‘accented’
   • ‘faint’
   • ‘variable-pitch’
   • ‘underline’
   • A font weight, which must be supported by the underlying typeface:
        • ‘thin’
        • ‘ultralight’
        • ‘extralight’
        • ‘light’
        • ‘semilight’
        • ‘regular’
        • ‘medium’
        • ‘semibold’
        • ‘bold’
        • ‘heavy’
        • ‘extrabold’
        • ‘ultrabold’
   • A floating point as a height multiple of the default or a cons cell
     in the form of ‘(height . FLOAT)’
   • ‘all-buttons’

   The default (a nil value or an empty list) is a gray background
combined with a pseudo three-dimensional effect.

   The ‘flat’ property makes the button two dimensional.

   The ‘accented’ property changes the background from gray to an accent
color.

   The ‘faint’ property reduces the overall coloration.

   The ‘variable-pitch’ property applies a proportionately spaced
typeface to the button~s text.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.

   The ‘underline’ property draws a line below the affected text and
removes whatever box effect.  This is optimal when Emacs runs inside a
terminal emulator (*note More accurate colors in terminal emulators::).
If ‘flat’ and ‘underline’ are defined together, the latter takes
precedence.

   The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the button
accordingly, such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’, etc.  Valid symbols are
defined in the variable ‘modus-themes-weights’.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   A number, expressed as a floating point (e.g.  ‘0.9’), adjusts the
height of the button’s text to that many times the base font size.  The
default height is the same as ‘1.0’, though it need not be explicitly
stated.  Instead of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the
form of a cons cell like ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or ‘(height FLOAT)’, where
FLOAT is the given number.

   The ‘all-buttons’ property extends the box button effect (or the
aforementioned properties) to the faces of the generic widget library.
By default, those do not look like the buttons of the Custom UI as they
are ordinary text wrapped in square brackets.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (flat)
     (variable-pitch flat)
     (variable-pitch flat semibold 0.9)
     (variable-pitch flat semibold (height 0.9)) ; same as above
     (variable-pitch flat semibold (height . 0.9)) ; same as above

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-box-buttons '(variable-pitch flat 0.9))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Command prompts,  Next: Mode line,  Prev: Box buttons,  Up: Customization Options

4.9 Option for command prompt styles
====================================

Brief: Control the style of command prompts (e.g.  minibuffer, shell,
IRC clients).

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-prompts’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘background’
   • ‘bold’
   • ‘gray’
   • ‘intense’
   • ‘italic’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) means to only use a
subtle accented foreground color.

   The property ‘background’ applies a background color to the prompt’s
text.  By default, this is a subtle accented value.

   The property ‘intense’ makes the foreground color more prominent.  If
the ‘background’ property is also set, it amplifies the value of the
background as well.

   The property ‘gray’ changes the prompt’s colors to grayscale.  This
affects the foreground and, if the ‘background’ property is also set,
the background.  Its effect is subtle, unless it is combined with the
‘intense’ property.

   The property ‘bold’ makes the text use a bold typographic weight.
Similarly, ‘italic’ adds a slant to the font’s forms (italic or oblique
forms, depending on the typeface).

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (intense)
     (bold intense)
     (intense bold gray)
     (intense background gray bold)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-prompts '(background gray))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Mode line,  Next: Tab style,  Prev: Command prompts,  Up: Customization Options

4.10 Option for mode line presentation
======================================

Brief: Control the style of the mode lines.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mode-line’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values, which can be expressed as a list of combinations of
box effect, color, and border visibility:

   • Overall style:
        • ‘3d’
        • ‘moody’
   • ‘accented’
   • ‘borderless’
   • A natural number > 1 for extra padding or a cons cell in the form
     of ‘(padding . NATNUM)’.
   • A floating point to set the height of the mode line’s text.  It can
     also be a cons cell in the form of ‘(height . FLOAT)’.

   The default (a nil value or an empty list) is a two-dimensional
rectangle with a border around it.  The active and the inactive mode
lines use different shades of grayscale values for the background,
foreground, border.

   The ‘3d’ property applies a three-dimensional effect to the active
mode line.  The inactive mode lines remain two-dimensional and are toned
down a bit, relative to the default style.

   The ‘moody’ property optimizes the mode line for use with the library
of the same name (hereinafter referred to as ’Moody’).  In practice, it
removes the box effect and replaces it with underline and overline
properties.  It also tones down the inactive mode lines.  Despite its
intended purpose, this option can also be used without the Moody library
(please consult the themes’ manual on this point for more details).  If
both ‘3d’ and ‘moody’ properties are set, the latter takes precedence.

   The ‘borderless’ property removes the color of the borders.  It does
not actually remove the borders, but only makes their color the same as
the background, effectively creating some padding.

   The ‘accented’ property ensures that the active mode line uses a
colored background instead of the standard shade of gray.

   A positive integer (natural number or natnum) applies a padding
effect of NATNUM pixels at the boundaries of the mode lines.  The
default value is 1 and does not need to be specified explicitly.  The
padding has no effect when the ‘moody’ property is also used, because
Moody already applies its own tweaks.  To ensure that the underline is
placed at the bottom of the mode line, set ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’
to non-nil (this is not needed when the ‘borderless’ property is also
set).  For users on Emacs 29, the ‘x-use-underline-position-properties’
variable must also be set to nil.

   The padding can also be expressed as a cons cell in the form of
‘(padding . NATNUM)’ or ‘(padding NATNUM)’ where the key is constant and
NATNUM is the desired natural number.

   A floating point applies an adjusted height to the mode line’s text
as a multiple of the main font size.  The default rate is 1.0 and does
not need to be specified.  Apart from a floating point, the height may
also be expressed as a cons cell in the form of ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or
‘(height FLOAT)’ where the key is constant and the FLOAT is the desired
number.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (accented)
     (borderless 3d)
     (moody accented borderless)

   Same as above, using the padding and height as an example (these all
yield the same result):

     (accented borderless 4 0.9)
     (accented borderless (padding . 4) (height . 0.9))
     (accented borderless (padding 4) (height 0.9))

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-mode-line '(borderless accented))

   Note that Moody does not expose any faces that the themes could style
directly.  Instead it re-purposes existing ones to render its tabs and
ribbons.  As such, there may be cases where the contrast ratio falls
below the 7:1 target that the themes conform with (WCAG AAA). To hedge
against this, we configure a fallback foreground for the ‘moody’
property, which will come into effect when the background of the mode
line changes to something less accessible, such as Moody ribbons (read
the doc string of ‘set-face-attribute’, specifically
‘:distant-foreground’).  This fallback is activated when Emacs
determines that the background and foreground of the given construct are
too close to each other in terms of color distance.  In practice, users
will need to experiment with the variable
‘face-near-same-color-threshold’ to trigger the effect.  We find that a
value of ‘45000’ shall suffice, contrary to the default ‘30000’.  Though
for the combinations that involve the ‘accented’ and ‘moody’ properties,
as mentioned above, that should be raised up to ‘70000’.  Do not set it
too high, because it has the adverse effect of always overriding the
default colors (which have been carefully designed to be highly
accessible).

   Furthermore, because Moody expects an underline and overline instead
of a box style, it is strongly advised to set
‘x-underline-at-descent-line’ to a non-nil value.

   Finally, note that various packages which heavily modify the mode
line, such as ‘doom-modeline’, ‘nano-modeline’, ‘powerline’, ‘spaceline’
may not look as intended with all possible combinations of this user
option.

4.11 Option for accented background in tab interfaces
=====================================================

Brief: Toggle accent colors for tabbed interfaces.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-tabs-accented’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

   • ‘nil’ (default)
   • ‘t’

   By default, all tab interfaces use backgrounds which are shades of
gray.  When this option is set to non-nil, the backgrounds become
colorful.

   This affects the built-in ‘tab-bar-mode’ and ‘tab-line-mode’, as well
as the Centaur tabs package.

4.12 Option for completion framework aesthetics
===============================================

Brief: Set the overall style of completion framework interfaces.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-completions’ (‘alist’ type properties)

   This affects Company, Corfu, Flx, Helm, Icomplete/Fido, Ido, Ivy,
Orderless, Selectrum, Vertico.  The value is an alist that takes the
form of a ‘(key . properties)’ combination.  Here is a sample, followed
by a description of the particularities:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((matches . (extrabold background intense))
             (selection . (semibold accented intense))
             (popup . (accented))))

   The ‘matches’ key refers to the highlighted characters that
correspond to the user’s input.  By default (nil or an empty list), they
have a bold weight and a colored foreground.  The list of properties may
include any of the following symbols regardless of the order they may
appear in:

   • ‘background’ to add a background color;

   • ‘intense’ to increase the overall coloration (also amplifies the
     ‘background’, if present);

   • ‘underline’ to draw a line below the characters;

   • ‘italic’ to use a slanted font (italic or oblique forms);

   • The symbol of a font weight attribute such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’,
     et cetera.  Valid symbols are defined in the ‘modus-themes-weights’
     variable.  The absence of a weight means that bold will be used.

   The ‘selection’ key applies to the current line or currently matched
candidate, depending on the specifics of the User Interface.  By default
(nil or an empty list), it has a subtle gray background, a bold weight,
and the base foreground value for the text.  The list of properties it
accepts is as follows (order is not significant):

   • ‘accented’ to make the background colorful instead of gray;

   • ‘text-also’ to apply extra color to the text of the selected line;

   • ‘intense’ to increase the overall coloration;

   • ‘underline’ to draw a line below the characters;

   • ‘italic’ to use a slanted font (italic or oblique forms);

   • The symbol of a font weight attribute such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’,
     et cetera.  Valid symbols are defined in the ‘modus-themes-weights’
     variable.  The absence of a weight means that bold will be used.

   The ‘popup’ key takes the same values as ‘selection’.

   Apart from specfying each key separately, a fallback list is
accepted.  This is only useful when the desired aesthetic is the same
across all keys that are not explicitly referenced.  For example, this:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((t . (extrabold intense))))

   Is the same as:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((matches . (extrabold intense))
             (selection . (extrabold intense))
             (popup . (extrabold intense))))

   In the case of the fallback, any property that does not apply to the
corresponding key is simply ignored (‘matches’ does not have ‘accented’
and ‘text-also’, while ‘selection’ and ‘popup’ do not have
‘background’).

   A concise expression of those associations can be written as follows,
where the ‘car’ is always the key and the ‘cdr’ is the list of
properties (whatever order they may appear in):

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((matches extrabold background intense)
             (selection semibold accented intense)
             (popup accented)))

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   Also refer to the Orderless documentation for its intersection with
Company (if you choose to use those in tandem).

4.13 Option for mail citations
==============================

Brief: Set the overall style of citations/quotes when composing emails.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mail-citations’ (‘choice’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘intense’
  3. ‘faint’
  4. ‘monochrome’

   By default (a nil value) citations are styled with contrasting hues
to denote their depth.  Colors are easy to tell apart because they
complement each other, but they otherwise are not very prominent.

   Option ‘intense’ is similar to the default in terms of using
contrasting and complementary hues, but applies more saturated colors.

   Option ‘faint’ maintains the same color-based distinction between
citation levels though the colors it uses have subtle differences
between them.

   Option ‘monochrome’ turns all quotes into a shade of gray.

   Whatever the value assigned to this variable, citations in emails are
controlled by typographic elements or indentation, which the themes do
not touch.

4.14 Option for fringe visibility
=================================

Brief: Control the overall coloration of the fringes.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-fringes’ (‘choice’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘subtle’
  3. ‘intense’

   The default is to use the same color as that of the main background,
meaning that the fringes are not obvious though they still occupy the
space given to them by ‘fringe-mode’.

   Options ‘subtle’ and ‘intense’ apply a gray background, making the
fringes visible.  The difference between the two is one of degree, as
their names imply.

4.15 Option for language checkers
=================================

Brief: Control the style of in-buffer warnings and errors produced by
spell checkers, code linters, and the like.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-lang-checkers’ (‘choice’ type, list of
properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘straight-underline’
   • ‘text-also’
   • ‘background’
   • Overall coloration:
        • ‘intense’
        • ‘faint’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) applies a color-coded
underline to the affected text, while it leaves the original foreground
intact.  If the display spec of Emacs has support for it, the
underline’s style is that of a wave, otherwise it is a straight line.

   The property ‘straight-underline’ ensures that the underline under
the affected text is always drawn as a straight line.

   The property ‘text-also’ applies the same color of the underline to
the affected text.

   The property ‘background’ adds a color-coded background.

   The property ‘intense’ amplifies the applicable colors if
‘background’ and/or ‘text-also’ are set.  If ‘intense’ is set on its
own, then it implies ‘text-also’.

   The property ‘faint’ uses nuanced colors for the underline and for
the foreground when ‘text-also’ is included.  If both ‘faint’ and
‘intense’ are specified, the former takes precedence.

   Combinations of any of those properties can be expressed in a list,
as in those examples:

     (background)
     (straight-underline intense)
     (background text-also straight-underline)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-lang-checkers '(text-also background))

   NOTE: The placement of the straight underline, though not the wave
style, is controlled by the built-in variables
‘underline-minimum-offset’, ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’,
‘x-use-underline-position-properties’.

   To disable fringe indicators for Flymake or Flycheck, refer to
variables ‘flymake-fringe-indicator-position’ and
‘flycheck-indication-mode’, respectively.

4.16 Option for line highlighting
=================================

Brief: Control the style of the current line of ‘hl-line-mode’.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-hl-line’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘accented’
   • ‘intense’
   • ‘underline’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) is a subtle gray
background color.

   The property ‘accented’ changes the background to a colored variant.

   An ‘underline’ property draws a line below the highlighted area.  Its
color is similar to the background, so gray by default or an accent
color when ‘accented’ is also set.

   An ‘intense’ property amplifies the colors in use, which may be both
the background and the underline.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (intense)
     (underline intense)
     (accented intense underline)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-hl-line '(underline accented))

   Set ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’ to a non-nil value for better
results with underlines.

   This style affects several packages that enable ‘hl-line-mode’, such
as ‘elfeed’, ‘notmuch’, and ‘mu4e’.

   [ Also check the ‘lin’ package on GNU ELPA (by the author of the
modus-themes) for a stylistic enhancement to ‘hl-line-mode’.  ]

4.17 Option for line numbers
============================

Brief: Toggle subtle line numbers.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-subtle-line-numbers’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible value:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default style for ‘display-line-numbers-mode’ and its global
variant is to apply a subtle gray background to the line numbers.  The
current line has a more pronounced background and foreground combination
to bring more attention to itself.

   Similarly, the faces for ‘display-line-numbers-major-tick’ and its
counterpart ‘display-line-numbers-minor-tick’ use appropriate styles
that involve a bespoke background and foreground combination.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’), line numbers have no background of their
own.  Instead they retain the primary background of the theme, blending
with the rest of the buffer.  Foreground values for all relevant faces
are updated to accommodate this aesthetic.

4.18 Option for mouseover effects
=================================

Brief: Toggle intense mouse hover effects.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-intense-mouseovers’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible value:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   By default all mouseover effects apply a highlight with a subtle
colored background.  When non-nil, these have a more pronounced effect.

   Note that this affects the generic ‘highlight’ which, strictly
speaking, is not limited to mouse usage.

4.19 Option for markup style in Org and others
==============================================

Brief: Choose style of markup in Org, Markdown, and others (affects
constructs such as Org’s ‘=verbatim=’ and ‘~code~’).

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-markup’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

  1. ‘bold’
  2. ‘italic’
  3. ‘background’
  4. ‘intense’

   The ‘italic’ property applies a typographic slant (italics).

   The ‘bold’ property applies a heavier typographic weight.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   The ‘background’ property adds a background color.  The background is
a shade of gray, unless the ‘intense’ property is also set.

   The ‘intense’ property amplifies the existing coloration.  When
‘background’ is used, the background color is enhanced as well and
becomes tinted instead of being gray.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (bold)
     (bold italic)
     (bold italic intense)
     (bold italic intense background)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-markup '(bold italic))

4.20 Option for parenthesis matching
====================================

Brief: Control the style of matching delimiters produced by
‘show-paren-mode’.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-paren-match’ (‘choice’ type, list of
properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘bold’
   • ‘intense’
   • ‘underline’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) is a subtle background
color.

   The ‘bold’ property adds a bold weight to the characters of the
matching delimiters.

   The ‘intense’ property applies a more prominent background color to
the delimiters.

   The ‘underline’ property draws a straight line under the affected
text.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (bold)
     (underline intense)
     (bold intense underline)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-paren-match '(bold intense))

   This customization variable affects the built-in ‘show-paren-mode’
and the ‘smartparens’ package.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Active region,  Next: Diffs,  Prev: Matching parentheses,  Up: Customization Options

4.21 Option for active region
=============================

Brief: Control the style of the region.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-region’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘no-extend’
   • ‘bg-only’
   • ‘accented’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) is a prominent gray
background that overrides all foreground colors in the area it
encompasses.  Its reach extends to the edge of the window.

   The ‘no-extend’ property limits the region to the end of the line, so
that it does not reach the edge of the window.

   The ‘bg-only’ property makes the region’s background color more
subtle to allow the underlying text to retain its foreground colors.

   The ‘accented’ property applies a more colorful background to the
region.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (no-extend)
     (bg-only accented)
     (accented bg-only no-extend)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-region '(bg-only no-extend))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Diffs,  Next: Org mode blocks,  Prev: Active region,  Up: Customization Options

4.22 Option for diff buffer looks
=================================

Brief: Set the overall style of diffs.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-diffs’ (‘choice’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘desaturated’
  3. ‘bg-only’

   The default (‘nil’) uses fairly intense color combinations for diffs,
by applying prominently colored backgrounds, with appropriately tinted
foregrounds.

   Option ‘desaturated’ follows the same principles as with the default
(‘nil’), though it tones down all relevant colors.

   Option ‘bg-only’ applies a background but does not override the
text’s foreground.  This makes it suitable for a non-nil value passed to
‘diff-font-lock-syntax’ (note: Magit does not support syntax
highlighting in diffs—last checked on 2021-12-02).

   When the user option ‘modus-themes-deuteranopia’ is non-nil, all
diffs will use a red/blue color-coding system instead of the standard
red/green.  Other stylistic changes are made in the interest of
optimizing for such a use-case.

   *note Option for red-green color deficiency or deuteranopia:
Deuteranopia style.

   In versions before ‘2.0.0’ there was an option for foreground-only
diffs.  This is no longer supported at the theme level because there are
cases where the perceived contrast and overall contextuality were not
good enough although the applied colors were technically above the 7:1
contrast threshold.

   *note Diffs with only the foreground::.

   *note Ediff without diff color-coding::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Org mode blocks,  Next: Org agenda,  Prev: Diffs,  Up: Customization Options

4.23 Option for org-mode block styles
=====================================

Brief: Set the overall style of Org code blocks, quotes, and the like.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’ (‘choice’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘gray-background’ (value ‘grayscale’ exists for backward
     compatibility)
  3. ‘tinted-background’ (value ‘rainbow’ exists for backward
     compatibility)

   Nil (the default) means that the block has no background of its own:
it uses the one that applies to the rest of the buffer.  In this case,
the delimiter lines have a gray color for their text, making them look
exactly like all other Org properties.

   Option ‘gray-background’ applies a subtle gray background to the
block’s contents.  It also affects the begin and end lines of the block
as they get another shade of gray as their background, which
differentiates them from the contents of the block.  All background
colors extend to the edge of the window, giving the area a rectangular,
“blocky” presentation.

   Option ‘tinted-background’ uses a slightly colored background for the
contents of the block.  The exact color will depend on the programming
language and is controlled by the variable ‘org-src-block-faces’ (refer
to the theme’s source code for the current association list).  For this
to take effect, the Org buffer needs to be restarted with
‘org-mode-restart’.  In this scenario, it may be better to inhibit the
extension of the delimiter lines’ background to the edge of the window
because Org does not provide a mechanism to update their colors
depending on the contents of the block.  Disable the extension of such
backgrounds by setting ‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’ to nil.

   Code blocks use their major mode’s colors only when the variable
‘org-src-fontify-natively’ is non-nil.  While quote/verse blocks require
setting ‘org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks’ to a non-nil value.

   *note Update Org block delimiter fontification::.

   Older versions of the themes provided options ‘grayscale’ (or
‘greyscale’) and ‘rainbow’.  Those will continue to work as they are
aliases for ‘gray-background’ and ‘tinted-background’, respectively.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Org agenda,  Next: Heading styles,  Prev: Org mode blocks,  Up: Customization Options

4.24 Option for Org agenda constructs
=====================================

Brief: Control the style of the Org agenda.  Multiple parameters are
available, each with its own options.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-org-agenda’ (‘alist’ type, multiple styles)

   This is an alist that accepts a ‘(key . value)’ combination.  Some
values are specified as a list.  Here is a sample, followed by a
description of all possible combinations:

     (setq modus-themes-org-agenda
           '((header-block . (variable-pitch 1.5))
             (header-date . (grayscale workaholic bold-today 1.2))
             (event . (accented italic varied))
             (scheduled . uniform)
             (habit . traffic-light)))

   A ‘header-block’ key applies to elements that concern the headings
which demarcate blocks in the structure of the agenda.  By default (a
‘nil’ value) those are rendered in a bold typographic weight, plus a
height that is slightly taller than the default font size.  Acceptable
values come in the form of a list that can include either or both of
those properties:

   • ‘variable-pitch’ to use a proportionately spaced typeface;

   • A number as a floating point (e.g.  1.5) to set the height of the
     text to that many times the default font height.  A float of 1.0 or
     the symbol ‘no-scale’ have the same effect of making the font the
     same height as the rest of the buffer.  When neither a number nor
     ‘no-scale’ are present, the default is a small increase in height
     (a value of 1.15).

     Instead of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the form
     of a cons cell like ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or ‘(height FLOAT)’, where
     FLOAT is the given number.

   • The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the heading
     accordingly, such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’, etc.  Valid symbols are
     defined in the variable ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a
     weight means that bold will be used by virtue of inheriting the
     ‘bold’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   In case both a number and ‘no-scale’ are in the list, the latter
takes precedence.  If two numbers are specified, the first one is
applied.

   Example usage:

     (header-block . nil)
     (header-block . (1.5))
     (header-block . (no-scale))
     (header-block . (variable-pitch 1.5))
     (header-block . (variable-pitch 1.5 semibold))

   A ‘header-date’ key covers date headings.  Dates use only a
foreground color by default (a ‘nil’ value), with weekdays and weekends
having a slight difference in hueness.  The current date has an added
gray background.  This key accepts a list of values that can include any
of the following properties:

   • ‘grayscale’ to make weekdays use the main foreground color and
     weekends a more subtle gray;

   • ‘workaholic’ to make weekdays and weekends look the same in terms
     of color;

   • ‘bold-today’ to apply a bold typographic weight to the current
     date;

   • ‘bold-all’ to render all date headings in a bold weight;

   • ‘underline-today’ applies an underline to the current date while
     removing the background it has by default;

   • A number as a floating point (e.g.  1.2) to set the height of the
     text to that many times the default font height.  The default is
     the same as the base font height (the equivalent of 1.0).  Instead
     of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the form of a
     cons cell like ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or ‘(height FLOAT)’, where FLOAT
     is the given number.

   For example:

     (header-date . nil)
     (header-date . (workaholic))
     (header-date . (grayscale bold-all))
     (header-date . (grayscale workaholic))
     (header-date . (grayscale workaholic bold-today))
     (header-date . (grayscale workaholic bold-today scale-heading))

   An ‘event’ key covers (i) headings with a plain time stamp that are
shown on the agenda, also known as events, (ii) entries imported from
the diary, and (iii) other items that derive from a symbolic expression
or sexp (phases of the moon, holidays, etc.).  By default all those look
the same and have a subtle foreground color (the default is a nil value
or an empty list).  This key accepts a list of properties.  Those are:

   • ‘accented’ applies an accent value to the event’s foreground,
     replacing the original gray.  It makes all entries stand out more.
   • ‘italic’ adds a slant to the font’s forms (italic or oblique forms,
     depending on the typeface).
   • ‘varied’ differentiates between events with a plain time stamp and
     entries that are generated from either the diary or a symbolic
     expression.  It generally puts more emphasis on events.  When
     ‘varied’ is combined with ‘accented’, it makes only events use an
     accent color, while diary/sexp entries retain their original subtle
     foreground.  When ‘varied’ is used in tandem with ‘italic’, it
     applies a slant only to diary and sexp entries, not events.  And
     when ‘varied’ is the sole property passed to the ‘event’ key, it
     has the same meaning as the list (italic varied).  The combination
     of ‘varied’, ‘accented’, ‘italic’ covers all of the aforementioned
     cases.

   For example:

     (event . nil)
     (event . (italic))
     (event . (accented italic))
     (event . (accented italic varied))

   A ‘scheduled’ key applies to tasks with a scheduled date.  By default
(a ‘nil’ value), those use varying shades of yellow to denote (i) a past
or current date and (ii) a future date.  Valid values are symbols:

   • nil (default);
   • ‘uniform’ to make all scheduled dates the same color;
   • ‘rainbow’ to use contrasting colors for past, present, future
     scheduled dates.

   For example:

     (scheduled . nil)
     (scheduled . uniform)
     (scheduled . rainbow)

   A ‘habit’ key applies to the ‘org-habit’ graph.  All possible value
are passed as a symbol.  Those are:

   • The default (‘nil’) is meant to conform with the original aesthetic
     of ‘org-habit’.  It employs all four color codes that correspond to
     the org-habit states—clear, ready, alert, and overdue—while
     distinguishing between their present and future variants.  This
     results in a total of eight colors in use: red, yellow, green,
     blue, in tinted and shaded versions.  They cover the full set of
     information provided by the ‘org-habit’ consistency graph.
   • ‘simplified’ is like the default except that it removes the
     dichotomy between current and future variants by applying uniform
     color-coded values.  It applies a total of four colors: red,
     yellow, green, blue.  They produce a simplified consistency graph
     that is more legible (or less busy) than the default.  The intent
     is to shift focus towards the distinction between the four states
     of a habit task, rather than each state’s present/future outlook.
   • ‘traffic-light’ further reduces the available colors to red,
     yellow, and green.  As in ‘simplified’, present and future variants
     appear uniformly, but differently from it, the ‘clear’ state is
     rendered in a green hue, instead of the original blue.  This is
     meant to capture the use-case where a habit task being too early is
     less important than it being too late.  The difference between
     ready and clear states is attenuated by painting both of them using
     shades of green.  This option thus highlights the alert and overdue
     states.
   • When ‘modus-themes-deuteranopia’ is non-nil the exact style of the
     habit graph adapts to the needs of users with red-green color
     deficiency by substituting every instance of green with blue or
     cyan (depending on the specifics).

   *note Option for red-green color deficiency or deuteranopia:
Deuteranopia style.

   For example:

     (habit . nil)
     (habit . simplified)
     (habit . traffic-light)

       (event . (accented varied))

4.25 Option for the headings’ overall style
===========================================

Brief: Heading styles with optional list of values for levels 0-8.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-headings’ (‘alist’ type, multiple properties)

   This is an alist that accepts a ‘(key . list-of-values)’ combination.
The key is either a number, representing the heading’s level (0-8) or t,
which pertains to the fallback style.

   Level 0 is a special heading: it is used for what counts as a
document title or equivalent, such as the ‘#+title’ construct we find in
Org files.  Levels 1-8 are regular headings.

   The list of values covers symbols that refer to properties, as
described below.  Here is a complete sample, followed by a presentation
of all available properties:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (background overline variable-pitch 1.5))
             (2 . (overline rainbow 1.3))
             (3 . (overline 1.1))
             (t . (monochrome))))

   Properties:

   • ‘rainbow’
   • ‘overline’
   • ‘background’
   • ‘monochrome’
   • A font weight, which must be supported by the underlying typeface:
        • ‘thin’
        • ‘ultralight’
        • ‘extralight’
        • ‘light’
        • ‘semilight’
        • ‘regular’
        • ‘medium’
        • ‘semibold’
        • ‘bold’
        • ‘heavy’
        • ‘extrabold’
        • ‘ultrabold’
   • ‘no-bold’ (deprecated alias of a ‘regular’ weight)
   • A floating point as a height multiple of the default or a cons cell
     in the form of ‘(height . FLOAT)’.

   By default (a ‘nil’ value for this variable), all headings have a
bold typographic weight and use a desaturated text color.

   A ‘rainbow’ property makes the text color more saturated.

   An ‘overline’ property draws a line above the area of the heading.

   A ‘background’ property adds a subtle tinted color to the background
of the heading.

   A ‘monochrome’ property makes the heading the same as the base color,
which is that of the ‘default’ face’s foreground.  When ‘background’ is
also set, ‘monochrome’ changes its color to gray.  If both ‘monochrome’
and ‘rainbow’ are set, the former takes precedence.

   A ‘variable-pitch’ property changes the font family of the heading to
that of the ‘variable-pitch’ face (normally a proportionately spaced
typeface).

   The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the heading
accordingly, such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’, etc.  Valid symbols are
defined in the variable ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a weight
means that bold will be used by virtue of inheriting the ‘bold’ face.
For backward compatibility, the ‘no-bold’ value is accepted, though
users are encouraged to specify a ‘regular’ weight instead.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   A number, expressed as a floating point (e.g.  1.5), adjusts the
height of the heading to that many times the base font size.  The
default height is the same as 1.0, though it need not be explicitly
stated.  Instead of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the
form of a cons cell like ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or ‘(height FLOAT)’, where
FLOAT is the given number.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (semibold)
     (rainbow background)
     (overline monochrome semibold 1.3)
     (overline monochrome semibold (height 1.3)) ; same as above
     (overline monochrome semibold (height . 1.3)) ; same as above

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (background overline rainbow 1.5))
             (2 . (background overline 1.3))
             (t . (overline semibold))))

   When defining the styles per heading level, it is possible to pass a
non-nil value (‘t’) instead of a list of properties.  This will retain
the original aesthetic for that level.  For example:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . t)           ; keep the default style
             (2 . (background overline))
             (t . (rainbow)))) ; style for all other headings

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (background overline))
             (2 . (rainbow semibold))
             (t . t))) ; default style for all other levels

   For Org users, the extent of the heading depends on the variable
‘org-fontify-whole-heading-line’.  This affects the ‘overline’ and
‘background’ properties.  Depending on the version of Org, there may be
others, such as ‘org-fontify-done-headline’.

4.26 Option for variable-pitch font in UI elements
==================================================

Brief: Toggle the use of proportionately spaced (‘variable-pitch’) fonts
in the User Interface.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-variable-pitch-ui’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   This option concerns User Interface elements that are under the
direct control of Emacs.  In particular: the mode line, header line, tab
bar, and tab line.

   The default is to use the same font as the rest of Emacs, which
usually is a monospaced family.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) apply a proportionately spaced typeface.
This is done by assigning the ‘variable-pitch’ face to the relevant
items.

things with precision (*note Customization Options::).

   This section is of interest only to users who are prepared to
maintain their own local tweaks and who are willing to deal with any

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: More accurate colors in terminal emulators,  Next: Range of color with terminal emulators,  Up: Advanced customization

5.1 More accurate colors in terminal emulators
==============================================

[ This is based on partial information.  Please help verify and/or
expand these findings.  ]

   The graphical version of Emacs can reproduce color values accurately.
Whereas things get more tricky when Emacs is used in a terminal
emulator, because the terminals’ own capabilities determine the number
of colors that may be displayed: the Modus themes don’t look as good in
that case.

   There is, however, a way to instruct supported terminal emulators to
use more accurate colors.  In a shell prompt type ‘toe -a | grep direct’
to get a list of relevant terminfo entries.  There should be items such
as ‘xterm-direct’, ‘alacritty-direct’, ‘kitty-direct’.  Once you find
the one that corresponds to your terminal, call Emacs with an
environment variable like ‘TERM=xterm-direct’.  Example that can be
adapted to shell aliases:

     TERM=xterm-direct emacsclient -nw

   Another example that can be bound to a key:

     TERM=xterm-direct uxterm -e emacsclient -nw

5.2 Range of color with terminal emulators
==========================================

[ This is based on partial information.  Please help verify and/or
expand these findings.  ]

   When Emacs runs in a non-windowed session its color reproduction
capacity is framed or determined by the underlying terminal emulator
(*note More accurate colors in terminal emulators::).  Emacs cannot
produce a color that lies outside the range of what the terminal’s color
palette renders possible.

   This is immediately noticeable when the terminal’s first 16 codes do
not include a pure black value for the ‘termcol0’ entry and a pure white
for ‘termcol15’.  Emacs cannot set the correct background (white for
‘modus-operandi’; black for ‘modus-vivendi’) or foreground (inverse of
the background).  It thus falls back to the closest approximation, which
seldom is appropriate for the purposes of the Modus themes.

   In such a case, the user is expected to update their terminal’s color
palette such as by adapting these resources:

5.3 Visualize the active Modus theme’s palette
==============================================

The command ‘modus-themes-list-colors’ prompts for a choice between
‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’ to produce a help buffer that shows
a preview of each variable in the given theme’s color palette.  The
command ‘modus-themes-list-colors-current’ skips the prompt, using the
current Modus theme.

   Each row shows a foreground and background coloration using the
underlying value it references.  For example a line with ‘#a60000’ (a
shade of red) will show red text followed by a stripe with that same
color as a backdrop.

   The name of the buffer describes the given Modus theme.  It is thus
called ‘*modus-operandi-list-colors*’ or ‘*modus-vivendi-list-colors*’.

5.4 Per-theme customization settings
====================================

If you prefer to maintain different customization options between the
two themes, it is best you write your own functions that first set those
options and then load the relevant theme.  The following code does
exactly that by simply differentiating the two themes on the choice of
bold constructs in code syntax (enabled for one, disabled for the
other).

     (defun my-demo-modus-operandi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs t) ; ENABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-operandi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-vivendi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs nil) ; DISABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-vivendi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-themes-toggle ()
       (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-operandi)
           (my-demo-modus-vivendi)
         (my-demo-modus-operandi)))

   Then assign ‘my-demo-modus-themes-toggle’ to a key instead of the
equivalent the themes provide.

   For a more elaborate design, it is better to inspect the source code
of ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and relevant functions.

5.5 Case-by-case face specs using the themes’ palette
=====================================================

This section is about tweaking individual faces.  If you plan to do
things at scale, consult the next section: *note Set multiple faces:
Face specs at scale using the themes' palette.

   We already covered in previous sections how to toggle between the
themes and how to configure options prior to loading.  We also explained
that some of the functions made available to users will fire up a hook
that can be used to pass tweaks in the post-theme-load phase.

   Now assume you wish to change a single face, say, the ‘cursor’.  And
you would like to get the standard “blue” color value of the active
Modus theme, whether it is Modus Operandi or Modus Vivendi.  To do that,
you can use the ‘modus-themes-color’ function.  It accepts a symbol that
is associated with a color in ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’.  Like this:

     (modus-themes-color 'blue)

   The function always extracts the color value of the active Modus
theme.

     (progn
       (load-theme 'modus-operandi t)
       (modus-themes-color 'blue))           ; "#0031a9" for `modus-operandi'

     (progn
       (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t)
       (modus-themes-color 'blue))           ; "#2fafff" for `modus-vivendi'

   Do ‘C-h v’ on the aforementioned variables to check all the available
symbols that can be passed to this function.  Or simply invoke the
command ‘modus-themes-list-colors’ to produce a buffer with a preview of
each entry in the palette.

   *note Visualize the active Modus theme's palette::.

   With that granted, let us expand the example to actually change the
‘cursor’ face’s background property.  We employ the built-in function of
‘set-face-attribute’:

     (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color 'blue))

   If you evaluate this form, your cursor will become blue.  But if you
change themes, such as with ‘modus-themes-toggle’, your edits will be
lost, because the newly loaded theme will override the ‘:background’
attribute you had assigned to that face.

   For such changes to persist, we need to make them after loading the
theme.  So we rely on ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which gets
called from ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’, ‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’,
as well as the command ‘modus-themes-toggle’.  Here is a sample function
that tweaks two faces and then gets added to the hook:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color 'blue))
       (set-face-attribute 'font-lock-type-face nil :foreground (modus-themes-color 'magenta-alt)))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading::.

   Using this principle, it is possible to override the styles of faces
without having to find color values for each case.

   Another application is to control the precise weight for bold
constructs.  This is particularly useful if your typeface has several
variants such as “heavy”, “extrabold”, “semibold”.  All you have to do
is edit the ‘bold’ face.  For example:

     (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold)

   Remember to use the custom function and hook combo we demonstrated
above.  Because the themes do not hard-wire a specific weight, this
simple form is enough to change the weight of all bold constructs
throughout the interface.

   Finally, there are cases where you want to tweak colors though wish
to apply different ones to each theme, say, a blue hue for Modus
Operandi and a shade of red for Modus Vivendi.  To this end, we provide
‘modus-themes-color-alts’ as a convenience function to save you from the
trouble of writing separate wrappers for each theme.  It still returns a
single value by querying either of ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’, only here you pass the two keys you want,
first for ‘modus-operandi’ then ‘modus-vivendi’.

   Take the previous example with the ‘cursor’ face:

     ;; Blue for `modus-operandi' and red for `modus-vivendi'
     (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color-alts 'blue 'red))

5.6 Face specs at scale using the themes’ palette
=================================================

The examples here are for large scale operations.  For simple, one-off
tweaks, you may prefer the approach documented in the previous section
(*note Case-by-case face specs using the themes' palette::).

   The ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro lets you retrieve multiple color
values by employing the backquote/backtick and comma notation.  The
values are stored in the alists ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’, while the macro always queries that of
the active Modus theme (preview the current palette with the command
‘modus-themes-list-colors’).

   *note Visualize the active Modus theme's palette::.

   Here is an abstract example that just returns a list of color values
while ‘modus-operandi’ is enabled:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (list fg-main
             blue-faint
             magenta
             magenta-alt-other
             cyan-alt-other
             fg-special-cold
             blue-alt
             magenta-faint
             cyan
             fg-main
             green-faint
             red-alt-faint
             blue-alt-faint
             fg-special-warm
             cyan-alt
             blue))
     ;; =>
     ;; ("#000000" "#002f88" "#721045" "#5317ac"
     ;;  "#005a5f" "#093060" "#2544bb" "#752f50"
     ;;  "#00538b" "#000000" "#104410" "#702f00"
     ;;  "#003f78" "#5d3026" "#30517f" "#0031a9")

   Getting a list of colors may have its applications, though what you
are most likely interested in is how to use those variables to configure
several faces at once.  To do so we can rely on the built-in
‘custom-set-faces’ function, which sets face specifications for the
special ‘user’ theme.  That “theme” gets applied on top of regular
themes like ‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’.

   This is how it works:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(cursor ((,class :background ,blue)))
        `(mode-line ((,class :background ,yellow-nuanced-bg
                             :foreground ,yellow-nuanced-fg)))
        `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :background ,blue-nuanced-bg
                                      :foreground ,blue-nuanced-fg)))))

   The above snippet will immediately refashion the faces it names once
it is evaluated.  However, if you switch between the Modus themes, say,
from ‘modus-operandi’ to ‘modus-vivendi’, the colors will not get
updated to match those of the new theme.  To make things work across the
themes, we need to employ the same technique we discussed in the
previous section, namely, to pass our changes at the post-theme-load
phase via a hook.

   The themes provide the ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which
gets called from ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’,
‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’, as well as the command
‘modus-themes-toggle’.  With this knowledge, you can wrap the macro in a
function and then assign that function to the hook.  Thus:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(cursor ((,class :background ,blue)))
          `(mode-line ((,class :background ,yellow-nuanced-bg
                               :foreground ,yellow-nuanced-fg)))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :background ,blue-nuanced-bg
                                        :foreground ,blue-nuanced-fg))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading::.

   To discover the faces defined by all loaded libraries, you may do
‘M-x list-faces-display’.  Be warned that when you ‘:inherit’ a face you
are introducing an implicit dependency, so try to avoid doing so for
libraries other than the built-in ‘faces.el’ (or at least understand
that things may break if you inherit from a yet-to-be-loaded face).

   Also bear in mind that these examples are meant to work with the
Modus themes.  If you are cycling between multiple themes you may
encounter unforeseen issues, such as the colors of the Modus themes
being applied to a non-Modus item.

   Finally, note that you can still use other functions where those make
sense.  For example, the ‘modus-themes-color-alts’ that was discussed in
the previous section.  Adapt the above example like this:

     ...
     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(cursor ((,class :background ,(modus-themes-color-alts 'blue 'green))))
        ...))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Remap face with local value,  Next: Cycle through arbitrary colors,  Prev: Face specs at scale using the themes' palette,  Up: Advanced customization

5.7 Remap face with local value
===============================

There are cases where we need to change the buffer-local attributes of a
face.  This might be because we have our own minor mode that re-uses a
face for a particular purpose, such as a line selection tool that
activates ‘hl-line-mode’, but we wish to keep it distinct from other
buffers.  This is where ‘face-remap-add-relative’ can be applied and may
be combined with ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ to deliver consistent
results.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

   In this example we will write a simple interactive function that
adjusts the background color of the ‘region’ face.  This is the sample
code:

     (defvar my-rainbow-region-colors
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         `((red . ,red-subtle-bg)
           (green . ,green-subtle-bg)
           (yellow . ,yellow-subtle-bg)
           (blue . ,blue-subtle-bg)
           (magenta . ,magenta-subtle-bg)
           (cyan . ,cyan-subtle-bg)))
       "Sample list of color values for `my-rainbow-region'.")

     (defun my-rainbow-region (color)
       "Remap buffer-local attribute of `region' using COLOR."
       (interactive
        (list
         (completing-read "Pick a color: " my-rainbow-region-colors)))
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'region
        `( :background ,(alist-get (intern color) my-rainbow-region-colors)
           :foreground ,(face-attribute 'default :foreground))))

   When ‘my-rainbow-region’ is called interactively, it prompts for a
color to use.  The list of candidates is drawn from the car of each
association in ‘my-rainbow-region-colors’ (so “red”, “green”, etc.).

   To extend this principle, we may write wrapper functions that pass a
color directly.  Those can be useful in tandem with hooks.  Consider
this example:

     (defun my-rainbow-region-magenta ()
       (my-rainbow-region 'magenta))

     (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook #'my-rainbow-region-magenta)

   Whenever we enter a ‘diff-mode’ buffer, we now get a magenta-colored
region.

   Perhaps you may wish to generalise those findings in to a set of
functions that also accept an arbitrary face.  We shall leave the
experimentation up to you.

5.8 Cycle through arbitrary colors
==================================

Users may opt to customize individual faces of the themes to accommodate
their particular needs.  One such case is with the color intensity of
comments, specifically the foreground of ‘font-lock-comment-face’.  The
Modus themes set that to a readable value, in accordance with their
accessibility objective, though users may prefer to lower the overall
contrast on an on-demand basis.

   One way to achieve this is to design a command that cycles through
three distinct levels of intensity, though the following can be adapted
to any kind of cyclic behaviour, such as to switch between red, green,
and blue.

   In the following example, we employ the ‘modus-themes-color’ function
which reads a symbol that represents an entry in the active theme’s
color palette (*note Case-by-case face specs using the themes'
palette::).  Those are stored in ‘my-modus-themes-comment-colors’.

     (defvar my-modus-themes-comment-colors
       ;; We are abusing the palette here, as those colors have their own
       ;; purpose in the palette, so please ignore the semantics of their
       ;; names.
       '((low . bg-region)
         (medium . bg-tab-inactive-alt)
         (high . fg-alt))
       "Alist of levels of intensity mapped to color palette entries.
     The entries are found in `modus-themes-operandi-colors' or
     `modus-themes-vivendi-colors'.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state nil
       "The cyclic state of `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'.
     For internal use.")

     (defun my-modus-themes--comment-foreground (degree state)
       "Set `font-lock-comment-face' foreground.
     Use `my-modus-themes-comment-colors' to extract the color value
     for each level of intensity.

     This is complementary to `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'."
       (let ((palette-colors my-modus-themes-comment-colors))
         (set-face-foreground
          'font-lock-comment-face
          (modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors)))
         (setq my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state state)
         (message "Comments are set to %s contrast" degree)))

     (defun my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color ()
       "Cycle through levels of intensity for comments.
     The levels are determined by `my-modus-themes-comment-colors'."
       (interactive)
       (pcase my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state
         ('nil
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'low 1))
         (1
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'medium 2))
         (_
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'high nil))))

   With the above, ‘M-x my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color’ will cycle
through the three levels of intensity that have been specified.

   Another approach is to not read from the active theme’s color palette
and instead provide explicit color values, either in hexadecimal RGB
notation (like ‘#123456’) or as the names that are displayed in the
output of ‘M-x list-colors-display’.  In this case, the alist with the
colors will have to account for the active theme, so as to set the
appropriate colors.  While this introduces a bit more complexity, it
ultimately offers greater flexibility on the choice of colors for such a
niche functionality (so there is no need to abuse the palette of the
active Modus theme):

     (defvar my-modus-themes-comment-colors
       '((light . ((low . "gray75")
                   (medium . "gray50")
                   (high . "#505050")))      ; the default for `modus-operandi'

         (dark . ((low . "gray25")
                  (medium . "gray50")
                  (high . "#a8a8a8"))))      ; the default for `modus-vivendi'
       "Alist of levels of intensity mapped to color values.
     For such colors, consult the command `list-colors-display'.  Pass
     the name of a color or its hex value.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state nil
       "The cyclic state of `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'.
     For internal use.")

     (defun my-modus-themes--comment-foreground (degree state)
         "Set `font-lock-comment-face' foreground.
     Use `my-modus-themes-comment-colors' to extract the color value
     for each level of intensity.

     This is complementary to `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'."
       (let* ((colors my-modus-themes-comment-colors)
              (levels (pcase (car custom-enabled-themes)
                        ('modus-operandi (alist-get 'light colors))
                        ('modus-vivendi (alist-get 'dark colors)))))
         (set-face-foreground
          'font-lock-comment-face
          (alist-get degree levels))
         (setq my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state state)
         (message "Comments are set to %s contrast" degree)))

     (defun my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color ()
       "Cycle through levels of intensity for comments.
     The levels are determined by `my-modus-themes-comment-colors'."
       (interactive)
       (pcase my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state
         ('nil
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'low 1))
         (1
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'medium 2))
         (_
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'high nil))))

   The effect of the above configurations on ‘font-lock-comment-face’ is
global.  To make it buffer-local, one must tweak the code to employ the
function ‘face-remap-add-relative’ (*note Remap face with local
value::).

   So this form in ‘my-modus-themes--comment-foreground’:

     ;; example 1
     (...
      (set-face-foreground
       'font-lock-comment-face
       (modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors)))
      ...)

     ;; example 2
     (...
      (set-face-foreground
       'font-lock-comment-face
       (alist-get degree levels))
      ...)

   Must become this:

     ;; example 1
     (...
      (face-remap-add-relative
       'font-lock-comment-face
       `(:foreground ,(modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors))))
      ...)

     ;; example 2
     (...
      (face-remap-add-relative
       'font-lock-comment-face
       `(:foreground ,(alist-get degree levels)))
      ...)

5.9 Override colors
===================

The themes provide a mechanism for overriding their color values.  This
is controlled by the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’
and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’, which are alists that should
mirror a subset of the associations in ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’
and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ respectively.  As with all
customizations, overriding must be done before loading the affected
theme.

   *note Visualize the active Modus theme's palette::.

   Let us approach the present topic one step at a time.  Here is a
simplified excerpt of the default palette for Modus Operandi with some
basic background values that apply to buffers and the mode line
(remember to inspect the actual value to find out all the associations
that can be overridden):

     (defconst modus-themes-operandi-colors
       '((bg-main . "#ffffff")
         (bg-dim . "#f8f8f8")
         (bg-alt . "#f0f0f0")
         (bg-active . "#d7d7d7")
         (bg-inactive . "#efefef")))

   As one can tell, we bind a key to a hexadecimal RGB color value.  Now
say we wish to override those specific values and have our changes
propagate to all faces that use those keys.  We could write something
like this, which adds a subtle ochre tint:

     (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides
           '((bg-main . "#fefcf4")
             (bg-dim . "#faf6ef")
             (bg-alt . "#f7efe5")
             (bg-active . "#e8dfd1")
             (bg-inactive . "#f6ece5")))

   Once this is evaluated, any subsequent loading of ‘modus-operandi’
will use those values instead of the defaults.  No further intervention
is required.

   To reset the changes, we apply this and reload the theme:

     (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil)

   Users who wish to leverage such a mechanism can opt to implement it
on-demand by means of a global minor mode.  The following snippet covers
both themes and expands to some more assosiations in the palette:

     (define-minor-mode my-modus-themes-tinted
       "Tweak some Modus themes colors."
       :init-value nil
       :global t
       (if my-modus-themes-tinted
           (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides
                 '((bg-main . "#fefcf4")
                   (bg-dim . "#faf6ef")
                   (bg-alt . "#f7efe5")
                   (bg-hl-line . "#f4f0e3")
                   (bg-active . "#e8dfd1")
                   (bg-inactive . "#f6ece5")
                   (bg-region . "#c6bab1")
                   (bg-header . "#ede3e0")
                   (bg-tab-active . "#fdf6eb")
                   (bg-tab-inactive . "#c8bab8"))
                 modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides
                 '((bg-main . "#100b17")
                   (bg-dim . "#161129")
                   (bg-alt . "#181732")
                   (bg-hl-line . "#191628")
                   (bg-active . "#282e46")
                   (bg-inactive . "#1a1e39")
                   (bg-region . "#393a53")
                   (bg-header . "#202037")
                   (bg-tab-active . "#120f18")
                   (bg-tab-inactive . "#3a3a5a")))
         (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil
               modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides nil)))

   A more neutral style for ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’ can
look like this:

     '((bg-main . "#f7f7f7")
       (bg-dim . "#f2f2f2")
       (bg-alt . "#e8e8e8")
       (bg-hl-line . "#eaeaef")
       (bg-active . "#e0e0e0")
       (bg-inactive . "#e6e6e6")
       (bg-region . "#b5b5b5")
       (bg-header . "#e4e4e4")
       (bg-tab-active . "#f5f5f5")
       (bg-tab-inactive . "#c0c0c0"))

   With those in place, one can use ‘M-x my-modus-themes-tinted’ and
then load the Modus theme of their choice.  The new palette subset will
come into effect: subtle ochre tints (or shades of gray) for Modus
Operandi and night sky blue shades for Modus Vivendi.  Switching between
the two themes, such as with ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’ will also use the
overrides.

   Given that this is a user-level customization, one is free to
implement whatever color values they desire, even if the possible
combinations fall below the minimum 7:1 contrast ratio that governs the
design of the themes (the WCAG AAA legibility standard).  Alternatively,
this can also be done programmatically (*note Override color
saturation::).

   The above are expanded into a fully fledged derivative elsewhere in
this document (*note Override colors completely::).

   For manual interventions it is advised to inspect the source code of
‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ for the
inline commentary: it explains what the intended use of each palette
subset is.

   Furthermore, users may benefit from the ‘modus-themes-contrast’
function that we provide: *note test color combinations: Measure color
contrast.  It measures the contrast ratio between two color values, so
it can help in overriding the palette (or a subset thereof) without
making the end result inaccessible.

5.10 Override color saturation
==============================

In the previous section we documented how one can override color values
manually (*note Override colors::).  Here we use a programmatic approach
which leverages the built-in ‘color-saturate-name’ function to adjust
the saturation of all color values used by the active Modus theme.  Our
goal is to prepare a counterpart of the active theme’s palette that
holds modified color values, adjusted for a percent change in
saturation.  A positive number amplifies the effect, while a negative
one will move towards a grayscale spectrum.

   We start with a function that can be either called from Lisp or
invoked interactively.  In the former scenario, we pass to it the rate
of change we want.  While in the latter, a minibuffer prompt asks for a
number to apply the desired effect.  In either case, we intend to assign
anew the value of ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’ (light theme)
and the same for ‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’ (dark theme).

     (defun my-modus-themes-saturate (percent)
       "Saturate current Modus theme palette overrides by PERCENT."
       (interactive
        (list (read-number "Saturation by percent: ")))
       (let* ((theme (modus-themes--current-theme))
              (palette (pcase theme
                         ('modus-operandi modus-themes-operandi-colors)
                         ('modus-vivendi modus-themes-vivendi-colors)
                         (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (overrides (pcase theme
                           ('modus-operandi 'modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides)
                           ('modus-vivendi 'modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides)
                           (_ (error "No Modus theme is active")))))
         (let (name cons colors)
           (dolist (cons palette)
             (setq name (color-saturate-name (cdr cons) percent))
             (setq name (format "%s" name))
             (setq cons `(,(car cons) . ,name))
             (push cons colors))
           (set overrides colors))
         (pcase theme
           ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
           ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi)))))

     ;; sample Elisp calls (or call `my-modus-themes-saturate' interactively)
     (my-modus-themes-saturate 50)
     (my-modus-themes-saturate -75)

   Using the above has an immediate effect, as it reloads the active
Modus theme.

   The ‘my-modus-themes-saturate’ function stores new color values in
the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’, meaning that it undoes changes
implemented by the user on individual colors.  To have both automatic
saturation adjustment across the board and retain per-case edits to the
palette, some tweaks to the above function are required.  For example:

     (defvar my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides
       '((fg-main . "#ead0c0")
         (bg-main . "#050515"))
       "My bespoke colors for `modus-vivendi'.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides
       '((fg-main . "#1a1a1a")
         (bg-main . "#fefcf4"))
       "My bespoke colors for `modus-operandi'.")

     (defun my-modus-themes-saturate (percent)
       "Saturate current Modus theme palette overrides by PERCENT.
     Preserve the color values stored in
     `my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides',
     `my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides'."
       (interactive
        (list (read-number "Saturation by percent: ")))
       (let* ((theme (modus-themes--current-theme))
              (palette (pcase theme
                         ('modus-operandi modus-themes-operandi-colors)
                         ('modus-vivendi modus-themes-vivendi-colors)
                         (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (overrides (pcase theme
                           ('modus-operandi 'modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides)
                           ('modus-vivendi 'modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides)
                           (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (extra-overrides (pcase theme
                                 ('modus-operandi my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides)
                                 ('modus-vivendi my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides)
                                 (_ (error "No Modus theme is active")))))
         (let (name cons colors)
           (dolist (cons palette)
             (setq name (color-saturate-name (cdr cons) percent))
             (setq name (format "%s" name))
             (setq cons `(,(car cons) . ,name))
             (push cons colors))
           (set overrides (append extra-overrides colors)))
         (pcase theme
           ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
           ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi)))))

   To disable the effect, one must reset the aforementioned variables of
the themes to ‘nil’.  Or specify a command for it, such as by taking
inspiration from the ‘modus-themes-toggle’ we already provide:

     (defun my-modus-themes-revert-overrides ()
       "Reset palette overrides and reload active Modus theme."
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil
             modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides nil)
       (pcase (modus-themes--current-theme)
         ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
         ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi))))

5.11 Override colors through blending
=====================================

This is yet another method of overriding color values.

   *note Override colors::.

   *note Override color saturation::.

   Building on ideas and concepts from the previous sections, this
method blends the entire palette at once with the chosen colors.  The
function ‘my-modus-themes-interpolate’ blends two colors, taking a value
from the themes and mixing it with a user-defined color to arrive at a
midpoint.  This scales to all background and foreground colors with the
help of the ‘my-modus-themes-tint-palette’ function.

     (setq my-modus-operandi-bg-blend "#fbf1c7"
           my-modus-operandi-fg-blend "#3a6084"
           my-modus-vivendi-bg-blend "#3a4042"
           my-modus-vivendi-fg-blend "#d7b765")

     ;; Adapted from the `kurecolor-interpolate' function of kurecolor.el
     (defun my-modus-themes-interpolate (color1 color2)
       (cl-destructuring-bind (r g b)
           (mapcar #'(lambda (n) (* (/ n 2) 255.0))
                   (cl-mapcar '+ (color-name-to-rgb color1) (color-name-to-rgb color2)))
         (format "#%02X%02X%02X" r g b)))

     (defun my-modus-themes-tint-palette (palette bg-blend fg-blend)
       "Modify Modus PALETTE programmatically and return a new palette.
     Blend background colors with BG-BLEND and foreground colors with FG-BLEND."
       (let (name cons colors)
         (dolist (cons palette)
           (let ((blend (if (string-match "bg" (symbol-name (car cons)))

5.12 Override colors completely
===============================

Based on the ideas we have already covered in these sections, the
following code block provides a complete, bespoke pair of color palettes
which override the defaults.  They are implemented as a minor mode, as
explained before (*note Override colors::).  We call them “Summertime”
for convenience.

     ;; Read the relevant blog post:
     ;; <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-07-26-modus-themes-color-override-demo/>
     (define-minor-mode modus-themes-summertime
       "Refashion the Modus themes by overriding their colors.

     This is a complete technology demonstration to show how to
     manually override the colors of the Modus themes.  I have taken
     good care of those overrides to make them work as a fully fledged
     color scheme that is compatible with all user options of the
     Modus themes.

     These overrides are usable by those who (i) like something more
     fancy than the comparatively austere looks of the Modus themes,
     and (ii) can cope with a lower contrast ratio.

     The overrides are set up as a minor mode, so that the user can
     activate the effect on demand.  Those who want to load the
     overrides at all times can either add them directly to their
     configuration or enable `modus-themes-summertime' BEFORE loading
     either of the Modus themes (if the overrides are evaluated after
     the theme, the theme must be reloaded).

     Remember that all changes to theme-related variables require a
     reload of the theme to take effect (the Modus themes have lots of
     user options, apart from those overrides).

     The `modus-themes-summertime' IS NOT an official extension to the
     Modus themes and DOES NOT comply with its lofty accessibility
     standards.  It is included in the official manual as guidance for
     those who want to make use of the color overriding facility we
     provide."

5.13 Font configurations for Org and others
===========================================

The themes are designed to optionally cope well with mixed font
configurations.  This mostly concerns ‘org-mode’ and ‘markdown-mode’,
though expect to find it elsewhere like in ‘Info-mode’.

   *note Option for font mixing: Mixed fonts.

   In practice it means that the user can safely opt for a more
prose-friendly proportionately spaced typeface as their default, while
spacing-sensitive elements like tables and inline code always use a
monospaced font, by inheriting from the ‘fixed-pitch’ face.

   Users can try the built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’ to see the
effect in action.

   To make everything use your desired font families, you need to
configure the ‘variable-pitch’ (proportional spacing) and ‘fixed-pitch’
(monospaced) faces respectively.  It may also be convenient to set your
main typeface by configuring the ‘default’ face the same way.

   [ The ‘fontaine’ package on GNU ELPA (by the author of the
modus-themes) is designed to handle this case.  ]

   Put something like this in your initialization file (also consider
reading the doc string of ‘set-face-attribute’):

     ;; Main typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 110)

     ;; Proportionately spaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Serif" :height 1.0)

     ;; Monospaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 1.5)

   Or employ the ‘face-attribute’ function to read an existing value,
such as if you want to make ‘fixed-pitch’ use the font family of the
‘default’ face:

     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family (face-attribute 'default :family))

   The next section shows how to make those work in a more elaborate
setup that is robust to changes between the Modus themes.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   Note the differences in the ‘:height’ property.  The ‘default’ face
must specify an absolute value, which is the point size × 10.  So if you
want to use a font at point size ‘11’, you set the height to ‘110’.(1)
Whereas every other face must either not specify a height or have a
value that is relative to the default, represented as a floating point.
If you use an integer, then that means an absolute height.  This is of
paramount importance: it ensures that all fonts can scale gracefully
when using something like the ‘text-scale-adjust’ command which only
operates on the base font size (i.e.  the ‘default’ face’s absolute
height).

   *note Note for EWW and Elfeed fonts: Note on SHR fonts.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) ‘:height’ values do not need to be rounded to multiples of ten:
the likes of ‘115’ are perfectly valid—some typefaces will change to
account for those finer increments.

5.14 Configure bold and italic faces
====================================

The Modus themes do not hardcode a ‘:weight’ or ‘:slant’ attribute in
the thousands of faces they cover.  Instead, they configure the generic
faces called ‘bold’ and ‘italic’ to use the appropriate styles and then
instruct all relevant faces that require emphasis to inherit from them.

   This practically means that users can change the particularities of
what it means for a construct to be bold/italic, by tweaking the ‘bold’
and ‘italic’ faces.  Cases where that can be useful include:

   • The default typeface does not have a variant with slanted glyphs
     (e.g.  Fira Mono/Code as of this writing on 2021-07-07), so the
     user wants to add another family for the italics, such as Hack.

   • The typeface of choice provides a multitude of weights and the user
     prefers the light one by default.  To prevent the bold weight from
     being too heavy compared to the light one, they opt to make ‘bold’
     use a semibold weight.

   • The typeface distinguishes between oblique and italic forms by
     providing different font variants (the former are just slanted
     versions of the upright forms, while the latter have distinguishing
     features as well).  In this case, the user wants to specify the
     font that applies to the ‘italic’ face.

   To achieve those effects, one must first be sure that the fonts they
use have support for those features.  It then is a matter of following
the instructions for all typeface tweaks.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.

   In this example, we set the default font family to Fira Code, while
we choose to render italics in the Hack typeface (obviously you need to
pick fonts that work well together):

     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Fira Code" :height 110)
     (set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family "Hack")

   And here we play with different weights, using Source Code Pro:

     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110 :weight 'light)
     (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold)

   To reset the font family, one can use this:

     (set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family 'unspecified)

   To ensure that the effects persist after switching between the Modus
themes (such as with ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’), the user needs to write
their configurations to a function and pass it to the
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’.  This is necessary because themes
set the styles of faces upon activation, overriding prior values where
conflicts occur between the previous and the current states (otherwise
changing themes would not be possible).

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading::.

   This is a minimal setup to preserve font configurations across theme
load phases.  For a more permanent setup, it is better to rely on the
‘custom-set-faces’ function: ‘set-face-attribute’ works just fine,
though it probably is better suited for quick previews or for smaller
scale operations (‘custom-set-faces’ follows the format used in the
source code of the themes, which can make it easier to redefine faces in
bulk).

     ;; our generic function
     (defun my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces ()
       (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110)
       (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold))

     ;; or use this if you configure a lot of face and attributes and
     ;; especially if you plan to use `modus-themes-with-colors', as shown
     ;; elsewhere in the manual
     (defun my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces ()
       (custom-set-faces
        '(default ((t :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110)))
        '(bold ((t :weight semibold)))))

     ;; and here is the hook
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces)

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Custom Org todo keyword and priority faces,  Next: Custom Org emphasis faces,  Prev: Configure bold and italic faces,  Up: Advanced customization

5.15 Custom Org todo keyword and priority faces
===============================================

Users of ‘org-mode’ have the option to configure various keywords and
priority cookies to better match their workflow.  User options are
‘org-todo-keyword-faces’ and ‘org-priority-faces’.

   As those are meant to be custom faces, it is futile to have the
themes guess what each user wants to use, which keywords to target, and
so on.  Instead, we can provide guidelines on how to customize things to
one’s liking with the intent of retaining the overall aesthetic of the
themes.

   Please bear in mind that the end result of those is not controlled by
the active Modus theme but by how Org maps faces to its constructs.
Editing those while ‘org-mode’ is active requires re-initialization of
the mode with ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.

   Let us assume you wish to visually differentiate your keywords.  You
have something like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(D)" "CANCEL(C)")
             (sequence "MEET(m)" "|" "MET(M)")
             (sequence "STUDY(s)" "|" "STUDIED(S)")
             (sequence "WRITE(w)" "|" "WROTE(W)")))

   You could then use a variant of the following to inherit from a face
that uses the styles you want and also to preserve the properties
applied by the ‘org-todo’ face (in case there is a difference between
the two):

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . '(bold org-todo))
             ("STUDY" . '(warning org-todo))
             ("WRITE" . '(shadow org-todo))))

   This will refashion the keywords you specify, while letting the other
items in ‘org-todo-keywords’ use their original styles (which are
defined in the ‘org-todo’ and ‘org-done’ faces).

   If you want back the defaults, try specifying just the ‘org-todo’
face:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . org-todo)
             ("STUDY" . org-todo)
             ("WRITE" . org-todo)))

   When you inherit from multiple faces, you need to quote the list as
shown further above.  The order is significant: the first entry is
applied on top of the second, overriding any properties that are
explicitly set for both of them: any property that is not specified is
not overridden, so, for example, if ‘org-todo’ has a background and a
foreground, while ‘font-lock-type-face’ only has a foreground, the
merged face will include the background of the former and the foreground
of the latter.  If you do not want to blend multiple faces, you do not
need a quoted list.  A pattern of ‘keyword . face’ will suffice.

   Both approaches can be used simultaneously, as illustrated in this
configuration of the priority cookies:

     (setq org-priority-faces
           '((?A . '(bold org-priority))
             (?B . org-priority)
             (?C . '(shadow org-priority))))

   To find all the faces that are loaded in your current Emacs session,
use ‘M-x list-faces-display’.  Try ‘M-x describe-variable’ as well and
then specify the name of each of those Org variables demonstrated above.
Their documentation strings will offer you further guidance.

   Recall that the themes let you retrieve a color from their palette.
Do it if you plan to control face attributes.

specs using the themes' palette.

5.16 Custom Org emphasis faces
==============================

Org provides the user option ‘org-emphasis-alist’ which assosiates a
character with a face, list of faces, or face attributes.  The default
specification of that variable looks like this:

     (setq org-emphasis-alist
           '(("*" bold)
             ("/" italic)
             ("_" underline)
             ("=" org-verbatim verbatim)
             ("~" org-code verbatim)
             ("+" (:strike-through t))))

   With the exception of ‘org-verbatim’ and ‘org-code’ faces, everything
else uses the corresponding type of emphasis: a bold typographic weight,
or italicised, underlined, and struck through text.

   The best way for users to add some extra attributes, such as a
foreground color, is to define their own faces and assign them to the
given emphasis marker/character.

   This is a custom face that extends the standard ‘bold’ face with a
red foreground value (so it colorises the text in addition to the bold
weight):

     (defface my-org-emphasis-bold
       '((default :inherit bold)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#a60000")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#ff8059"))
       "My bold emphasis for Org.")

   This face definition reads as follows:

   • Always inherit the ‘bold’ face (*note Configure bold and italic
     faces::).
   • For versions of Emacs that support at least 88 colors (graphical
     Emacs, for example) and use a light background, apply the ‘#a60000’
     value.
   • For the same kind of Emacs that has a dark background use the
     ‘#ff8059’ color instead.

   Same principle for how to extend ‘italic’ and ‘underline’ with, for
example, green and yellow hues, respectively:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-italic
       '((default :inherit italic)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#005e00")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#44bc44"))
       "My italic emphasis for Org.")

     (defface my-org-emphasis-underline
       '((default :inherit underline)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#813e00")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#d0bc00"))
       "My underline emphasis for Org.")

   In the case of a strike-through effect, we have no generic face to
inherit from, so we can write it as follows to also change the
foreground to a more subtle gray:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((default :strike-through t)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#505050")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#a8a8a8"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   Or we can just change the color of the line that strikes through the
text to, for example, a shade of red:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :strike-through "#972500")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :strike-through "#ef8b50"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   It is possible to combine those effects:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :strike-through "#972500" :foreground "#505050")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :strike-through "#ef8b50" :foreground "#a8a8a8"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   One may inspect the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ for possible color values.  Or call the
command ‘modus-themes-list-colors’ to show a buffer that previews each
entry in the palette.

   *note Visualize the active Modus theme's palette::.

   Once we have defined the faces we need, we must update the
‘org-emphasis-alist’.  Given that ‘org-verbatim’ and ‘org-code’ are
already styled by the themes, it probably is best not to edit them:

     (setq org-emphasis-alist
           '(("*" my-org-emphasis-bold)
             ("/" my-org-emphasis-italic)
             ("_" my-org-emphasis-underline)
             ("=" org-verbatim verbatim)
             ("~" org-code verbatim)
             ("+" my-org-emphasis-strike-through)))

   That’s it!  For changes to take effect in already visited Org files,
invoke ‘M-x org-mode-restart’.

5.17 Update Org block delimiter fontification
=============================================

As noted in the section about ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’, Org contains a
variable that determines whether the block’s begin and end lines are
extended to the edge of the window (*note Option for org-mode block
styles: Org mode blocks.).  The variable is
‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’.

   Users who change the style of Org blocks from time to time may prefer
to automatically update delimiter line fontification, such as with the
following setup:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil)))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook
               #'my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines)

   Then ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect, though manual
intervention can be circumvented by tweaking the function thus:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil))
       (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
         (font-lock-flush)))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Measure color contrast,  Next: Load theme depending on time of day,  Prev: Update Org block delimiter fontification,  Up: Advanced customization

5.18 Measure color contrast
===========================

The themes provide the functions ‘modus-themes-wcag-formula’ and
‘modus-themes-contrast’.  The former is a direct implementation of the
WCAG formula: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html>.  It
calculates the relative luminance of a color value that is expressed in
hexadecimal RGB notation.  While the latter function is just a
convenient wrapper for comparing the relative luminance between two
colors.

   In practice, one needs to work only with ‘modus-themes-contrast’.  It
accepts two color values and returns their contrast ratio.  Values range
from 1 to 21 (lowest to highest).  The themes are designed to always be
equal or higher than 7 for each combination of background and foreground
that they use (this is the WCAG AAA standard—the most demanding of its
kind).

   A couple of examples (rounded numbers):

     ;; Pure white with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#ffffff" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 1.37
     ;; That is an outright inaccessible combo

     ;; Pure black with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 15.3
     ;; That is a highly accessible combo

   It does not matter which color value comes first.  The ratio is
always the same.

   If one does not wish to read all the decimal points, it is possible
to try something like this:

     (format "%0.2f" (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00"))

   While it is fine to perform such calculations on a case-by-case
basis, it is preferable to implement formulas and tables for more
demanding tasks.  Such instruments are provided by ‘org-mode’ or
‘orgtbl-mode’, both of which are built into Emacs.  Below is such a
table that derives the contrast ratio of all colors in the first column
(pure red, green, blue) relative to the color specified in the first row
of the second column (pure white) and rounds the results:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |
     | #00ff00 |    1.37 |
     | #0000ff |    8.59 |
     #+tblfm: $2='(modus-themes-contrast $1 @1$2);%0.2f

   To measure color contrast one needs to start from a known value.
This typically is the background.  The Modus themes define an expanded
palette in large part because certain colors are only meant to be used
in combination with some others.  Consult the source code for the
minutia and relevant commentary.

   Such knowledge may prove valuable while attempting to override some
of the themes’ colors: *note Override colors::.

5.19 Load theme depending on time of day
========================================

While we do provide ‘modus-themes-toggle’ to manually switch between the
themes, users may also set up their system to perform such a task
automatically at sunrise and sunset.

   This can be accomplished by specifying the coordinates of one’s
location using the built-in ‘solar.el’ and then configuring the
‘circadian’ package:

     (use-package solar                      ; built-in
       :config
       (setq calendar-latitude 35.17
             calendar-longitude 33.36))

     (use-package circadian                  ; you need to install this
       :ensure
       :after solar
       (setq circadian-themes '((:sunrise . modus-operandi)
                                (:sunset  . modus-vivendi)))
       (circadian-setup))

5.20 Backdrop for pdf-tools
===========================

Most PDF files use a white background for their page, making it
impossible to discern the file’s boundaries in the buffer while using
the Modus Operandi theme.  To introduce a distinction between the
buffer’s backdrop and the PDF page’s background, the former must be
rendered as some shade of gray.  Ideally, ‘pdf-tools’ would provide a
face that the themes could support directly, though this does not seem
to be the case for the time being.  We must thus employ the face
remapping technique that is documented elsewhere in this document to
change the buffer-local value of the ‘default’ face.

   *note Remap face with local value::.

   To remap the buffer’s backdrop, we start with a function like this
one:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'default
        `(:background ,(modus-themes-color 'bg-alt))))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-backdrop)

   The idea is to assign that function to a hook that gets called when
‘pdf-tools’ renders the document: ‘pdf-tools-enabled-hook’.  This is
enough when you only use one theme.  However it has the downside of
setting the background color value only at render time.  In other words,
the face remapping function does not get evaluated anew whenever the
theme changes, such as upon invoking ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’.

   To have our face remapping adapt gracefully while switching between
the Modus themes, we need to also account for the current theme and
control the activation of ‘pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode’.  To which end
we arrive at something like the following, which builds on the above
example:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'default
        `(:background ,(modus-themes-color 'bg-alt))))

     (defun my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle ()
       (when (derived-mode-p 'pdf-view-mode)
         (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-vivendi)
             (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode 1)
           (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode -1))
         (my-pdf-tools-backdrop)))

     (defun my-pdf-tools-themes-toggle ()
       (mapc
        (lambda (buf)
          (with-current-buffer buf
            (my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)))
        (buffer-list)))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-pdf-tools-themes-toggle)

   With those in place, PDFs have a distinct backdrop for their page,
while buffers with major-mode as ‘pdf-view-mode’ automatically switches
to dark mode when ‘modus-themes-toggle’ is called.

5.21 Decrease mode line height
==============================

By default, the mode line of the Modus themes is set to 1 pixel width
for its ‘:box’ attribute.  In contrast, the mode line of stock Emacs is
-1 pixel.  This small difference is considered necessary for the
purposes of accessibility as our out-of-the-box design has a prominent
color around the mode line (a border) to make its boundaries clear.
With a negative width the border and the text on the mode line can feel
a bit more difficult to read under certain scenaria.

   Furthermore, the user option ‘modus-themes-mode-line’ (*note Mode
line::) does not allow for such a negative value because there are many
edge cases that simply make for a counter-intuitive set of
possibilities, such as a ‘0’ value not being acceptable by the
underlying face infrastructure, and negative values greater than ‘-2’
not being particularly usable.

   For these reasons, users who wish to decrease the overall height of
the mode line must handle things on their own by implementing the
methods for face customization documented herein.

   *note Basic face customization: Case-by-case face specs using the
themes' palette.

   One such method is to create a function that configures the desired
faces and hook it to ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’ so that it
persists while switching between the Modus themes with the command
‘modus-themes-toggle’.

   This one simply disables the box altogether, which will reduce the
height of the mode lines, but also remove their border:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil :box nil)
       (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :box nil))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   The above relies on the ‘set-face-attribute’ function, though users
who plan to re-use colors from the theme and do so at scale are better
off with the more streamlined combination of the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro and ‘custom-set-faces’.

   *note Face customization at scale: Face specs at scale using the
themes' palette.

   As explained before in this document, this approach has a syntax that
is consistent with the source code of the themes, so it probably is
easier to re-use parts of the design.

   The following emulates the stock Emacs style, while still using the
colors of the Modus themes (whichever attribute is not explicitly stated
is inherited from the underlying theme):

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(mode-line ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :style released-button))))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :color ,bg-region)))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   And this one is like the out-of-the-box style of the Modus themes,
but with the -1 height instead of 1:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(mode-line ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :color ,fg-alt))))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :color ,bg-region)))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   Finally, to also change the background color of the active mode line,
such as that it looks like the “accented” variant which is possible via
the user option ‘modus-themes-mode-line’, the ‘:background’ attribute
needs to be specified as well:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(mode-line ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :color ,fg-alt) :background ,bg-active-accent)))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :box (:line-width -1 :color ,bg-region)))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

5.22 Toggle themes without reloading them
=========================================

Users who have a stable setup and who only ever need to toggle between
the themes without triggering a full reload, are better off defining
their own command which calls ‘enable-theme’ instead of ‘load-theme’:

     (defun my-modus-themes-toggle ()
       "Toggle between `modus-operandi' and `modus-vivendi' themes.
     This uses `enable-theme' instead of the standard method of
     `load-theme'.  The technicalities are covered in the Modus themes
     manual."
       (interactive)
       (pcase (modus-themes--current-theme)
         ('modus-operandi (progn (enable-theme 'modus-vivendi)
                                 (disable-theme 'modus-operandi)))
         ('modus-vivendi (progn (enable-theme 'modus-operandi)
                                 (disable-theme 'modus-vivendi)))
         (_ (error "No Modus theme is loaded; evaluate `modus-themes-load-themes' first"))))

   *note Differences between loading and enabling::.

   Recall that ‘modus-themes-toggle’ uses ‘load-theme’.

5.23 A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading
============================================

The themes are designed with the intent to be useful to Emacs users of
varying skill levels, from beginners to experts.  This means that we try
to make things easier by not expecting anyone reading this document to
be proficient in Emacs Lisp or programming in general.

   Such a case is with the use of the
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which runs after
‘modus-themes-toggle’, ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’, or
‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’ is evaluated.  We recommend using that hook
for advanced customizations, because (1) we know for sure that it is
available once the themes are loaded, and (2) anyone consulting this
manual, especially the sections on enabling and loading the themes, will
be in a good position to benefit from that hook.

   Advanced users who have a need to switch between the Modus themes and
other items will find that such a hook does not meet their requirements:
it only works with the Modus themes and only with the aforementioned
functions.

   A theme-agnostic setup can be configured thus:

     (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil
        "Normal hook run after enabling a theme.")

     (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args)
        "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'."
        (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook))

     (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook)

   This creates the ‘after-enable-theme-hook’ and makes it run after
each call to ‘enable-theme’, which means that it will work for all
themes and also has the benefit that it does not depend on functions
such as ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and the others mentioned above.
‘enable-theme’ is called internally by ‘load-theme’, so the hook works
everywhere.

   Now this specific piece of Elisp may be simple for experienced users,
but it is not easy to read for newcomers, including the author of the
Modus themes for the first several months of their time as an Emacs
user.  Hence our hesitation to recommend it as part of the standard
setup of the Modus themes (it is generally a good idea to understand
what the implications are of advising a function).


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Diffs with only the foreground,  Next: Ediff without diff color-coding,  Prev: A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading,  Up: Advanced customization

5.24 Diffs with only the foreground
===================================

Buffers that show differences between versions of a file or buffer, such
as in ‘diff-mode’ and ‘ediff’ always use color-coded background and
foreground combinations.

   *note Option for diff buffer looks: Diffs.

   User may, however, prefer a style that removes the color-coded
backgrounds from regular changes while keeping them for word-wise (aka
“refined”) changes—backgrounds for word-wise diffs are helpful in
context.  To make this happen, one can use the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro (*note Face specs at scale using the
themes' palette::):

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(modus-themes-diff-added ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,green))) ; OR ,blue for deuteranopia
          `(modus-themes-diff-changed ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,yellow)))
          `(modus-themes-diff-removed ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,red)))

          `(modus-themes-diff-refine-added ((,class :background ,bg-diff-added :foreground ,fg-diff-added)))
          ;; `(modus-themes-diff-refine-added ((,class :background ,bg-diff-added-deuteran :foreground ,fg-diff-added-deuteran)))
          `(modus-themes-diff-refine-changed ((,class :background ,bg-diff-changed :foreground ,fg-diff-changed)))
          `(modus-themes-diff-refine-removed ((,class :background ,bg-diff-removed :foreground ,fg-diff-removed)))

          `(modus-themes-diff-focus-added ((,class :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,green))) ; OR ,blue for deuteranopia
          `(modus-themes-diff-focus-changed ((,class :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,yellow)))
          `(modus-themes-diff-focus-removed ((,class :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,red)))

          `(modus-themes-diff-heading ((,class :background ,bg-alt :foreground ,fg-main)))

          `(diff-indicator-added ((,class :foreground ,green))) ; OR ,blue for deuteranopia
          `(diff-indicator-changed ((,class :foreground ,yellow)))
          `(diff-indicator-removed ((,class :foreground ,red)))

          `(magit-diff-added ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,green-faint)))
          `(magit-diff-changed ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,yellow-faint)))
          `(magit-diff-removed ((,class :background unspecified :foreground ,red-faint)))
          `(magit-diff-context-highlight ((,class :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,fg-dim))))))

     ;; This is so that the changes persist when switching between
     ;; `modus-operandi' and `modus-vivendi'.
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   This used to be an optional style of ‘modus-themes-diffs’, but has
been removed since version ‘2.0.0’ to ensure that the accessibility
standard and aesthetic quality of the themes is not compromised.

5.25 Ediff without diff color-coding
====================================

Ediff uses the same color-coding as ordinary diffs in ‘diff-mode’,
Magit, etc.  (*note Option for diff buffer looks: Diffs.).  This is
consistent with the principle of least surprise.

   Users may, however, prefer to treat Ediff differently on the premise
that it does not need any particular color-coding to show added or
removed lines/words: it does not use the ‘+’ or ‘-’ markers, after all.

   This can be achieved by customizing the Ediff faces with color
combinations that do not carry the same connotations as those of diffs.
Consider this example, which leverages the ‘modus-themes-with-colors’
macro (*note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::):

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(ediff-current-diff-A ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-faint-cold :foreground ,fg-special-cold)))
          `(ediff-current-diff-B ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-faint-warm :foreground ,fg-special-warm)))
          `(ediff-current-diff-C ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-faint-calm :foreground ,fg-special-calm)))
          `(ediff-fine-diff-A ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-cold :foreground ,fg-special-cold)))
          `(ediff-fine-diff-B ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-warm :foreground ,fg-special-warm)))
          `(ediff-fine-diff-C ((,class :inherit unspecified :background ,bg-special-calm :foreground ,fg-special-calm))))))

     ;; This is so that the changes persist when switching between
     ;; `modus-operandi' and `modus-vivendi'.
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   Remove the ‘:foreground’ and its value to preserve the underlying
coloration.

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Near-monochrome syntax highlighting,  Next: Custom hl-todo colors,  Prev: Ediff without diff color-coding,  Up: Advanced customization

5.26 Near-monochrome syntax highlighting
========================================

While the Modus themes do provide a user option to control the overall
style of syntax highlighting in programming major modes, they do not
cover the possibility of a monochromatic or near-monochromatic design
(*note Option for syntax highlighting: Syntax styles.).  This is due to
the multitude of preferences involved: one may like comments to be
styled with an accent value, another may want certain constructs to be
bold, a third may apply italics to doc strings but not comments... The
possibilities are virtually endless.  As such, this sort of design is
best handled at the user level in accordance with the information
furnished elsewhere in this manual.

   *note Case-by-case face specs using the themes' palette::.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

   The gist is that we want to override the font-lock faces.  For our
changes to persist while switching between ‘modus-operandi’ and
‘modus-vivendi’ we wrap our face overrides in a function that we hook to
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’.

   Users who want to replicate the structure of the themes’ source code
are advised to use the examples with ‘custom-set-faces’.  Those who
prefer a different approach can use the snippets which call
‘set-face-attribute’.  Below are the code blocks.

   The following uses a yellow accent value for comments and green hues
for strings.  Regexp grouping constructs have color values that work in
the context of a green string.  All other elements use the main
foreground color, except warnings such as the ‘user-error’ function in
Elisp buffers which gets a subtle red tint (not to be confused with the
‘warning’ face which is used for genuine warnings).  Furthermore, notice
the ‘modus-themes-bold’ and ‘modus-themes-slant’ which apply the
preference set in the user options ‘modus-themes-bold-constructs’ and
‘modus-themes-italic-constructs’, respectively.  Users who do not want
this conditionally must replace these faces with ‘bold’ and ‘italic’
respectively (or ‘unspecified’ to disable the effect altogether).

     ;; This is the hook.  It will not be replicated across all code samples.
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-subtle-syntax)

5.27 Custom hl-todo colors
==========================

The ‘hl-todo’ package provides the user option ‘hl-todo-keyword-faces’:
it specifies a pair of keyword and corresponding color value.  The Modus
themes configure that option in the interest of legibility.  While this
works for our purposes, users may still prefer to apply their custom
values, in which case the following approach is necessary:

     (defun my-modus-themes-hl-todo-faces ()

5.28 Add support for solaire-mode
=================================

The ‘solaire-mode’ package dims the background of what it considers
ancillary “UI” buffers, such as the minibuffer and Dired buffers.  The
Modus themes used to support Solaire on the premise that the user was
(i) opting in to it, (ii) understood why certain buffers were more gray,
and (iii) knew what other adjustments had to be made to prevent broken
visuals (e.g.  the default style of the ‘modus-themes-completions’ uses
a subtle gray background for the selection, which with Solaire becomes
practically invisible).

   However, the assumption that users opt in to this feature does not
always hold true.  There are cases where it is enabled by defaultsuch as
in the popular Doom Emacs configuration.  Thus, the unsuspecting user
who loads ‘modus-operandi’ or ‘modus-vivendi’ without the requisite
customizations is getting a sub-par experience; an experience that we
did not intend and cannot genuinely fix.

   Because the Modus themes are meant to work everywhere, we cannot make
an exception for Doom Emacs and/or Solaire users.  Furthermore, we shall
not introduce hacks, such as by adding a check in all relevant faces to
be adjusted based on Solaire or whatever other package.  Hacks of this
sort are unsustainable and penalize the entire userbase.  Besides, the
themes are built into Emacs and we must keep their standard high.

   The fundamental constraint with Solaire is that Emacs does not have a
real distinction between “content” and “UI” buffers.  For themes to work
with Solaire, they need to be designed around that package.  Such is an
arrangement that compromises on our accessibility standards and/or
hinders our efforts to provide the best possible experience while using
the Modus themes.

   As such, ‘solaire-mode’ is not—and will not be—supported by the Modus
themes (or any other of my themes, for that matter).  Users who want it
must style the faces manually.  Below is some sample code, based on what
we cover at length elsewhere in this manual:

   *note Advanced customization::.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(solaire-default-face ((,class :inherit default :background ,bg-alt :foreground ,fg-dim)))
          `(solaire-line-number-face ((,class :inherit solaire-default-face :foreground ,fg-unfocused)))
          `(solaire-hl-line-face ((,class :background ,bg-active)))
          `(solaire-org-hide-face ((,class :background ,bg-alt :foreground ,bg-alt))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

7.1 Note on calendar.el weekday and weekend colors
==================================================

By default, the ‘M-x calendar’ interface differentiates weekdays from
weekends by applying a gray color to the former and a faint red to the
latter.  The idea for this approach is that the weekend should serve as
a subtle warning that no work is supposed to be done on that day, per
the design of traditional calendars.

   Users who prefer all days to look the same can configure the variable
‘calendar-weekend-days’ to either use gray of weekdays or the faint red
of weekends uniformly.

     ;; All are treated like weekdays (gray color)
     (setq calendar-weekend-days nil)

     ;; All are treated like weekends (red-faint color)
     (setq calendar-weekend-days (number-sequence 0 6))

     ;; The default marks the Saturday and Sunday as the weekend
     (setq calendar-weekend-days '(0 6))

   For changes to take effect, the Calendar buffer needs to be generated
anew.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on git-gutter in Doom Emacs,  Next: Note on php-mode multiline comments,  Prev: Note on calendarel weekday and weekend colors,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.2 Note on git-gutter in Doom Emacs
====================================

The ‘git-gutter’ and ‘git-gutter-fr’ packages default to drawing bitmaps
for the indicators they display (e.g.  bitmap of a plus sign for added
lines).  In Doom Emacs, these bitmaps are replaced with contiguous lines
which may look nicer, but require a change to the foreground of the
relevant faces to yield the desired colour combinations.

   Since this is Doom-specific, we urge users to apply changes in their
local setup.  Below is some sample code, based on what we cover at
length elsewhere in this manual:

   *note Advanced customization::.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Replace green with blue if you use `modus-themes-deuteranopia'.
          `(git-gutter-fr:added ((,class :foreground ,green-fringe-bg)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((,class :foreground ,red-fringe-bg)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((,class :foreground ,yellow-fringe-bg))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

   If the above does not work, try this instead:

     (after! modus-themes
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Replace green with blue if you use `modus-themes-deuteranopia'.
          `(git-gutter-fr:added ((,class :foreground ,green-fringe-bg)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((,class :foreground ,red-fringe-bg)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((,class :foreground ,yellow-fringe-bg))))))

   Replace ‘green-fringe-bg’ with ‘blue-fringe-bg’ if you want to
optimize for red-green color deficiency.

   *note Option for red-green color deficiency or deuteranopia:
Deuteranopia style.

7.3 Note on php-mode multiline comments
=======================================

Depending on your build of Emacs and/or the environment it runs in,
multiline comments in PHP with the ‘php-mode’ package use the
‘font-lock-doc-face’ instead of ‘font-lock-comment-face’.

   This seems to make all comments use the appropriate face:

     (defun my-multine-comments ()
       (setq-local c-doc-face-name 'font-lock-comment-face))

     (add-hook 'php-mode-hook #'my-multine-comments)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

7.4 Note on underlines in compilation buffers
=============================================

Various buffers that produce compilation results or run tests on code
apply an underline to the file names they reference or to relevant
messages.  Users may consider this unnecessary or excessive.

   To outright disable the effect, use this (buffers need to be
generated anew):

     (setq compilation-message-face nil)

   If some element of differentiation is still desired, a good option is
to render the affected text with the ‘italic’ face:

     (setq compilation-message-face 'italic)

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on inline Latex in Org buffers,  Next: Note on dimmerel,  Prev: Note on underlines in compilation buffers,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.5 Note on inline Latex in Org buffers
=======================================

Org can work with inline latex and related syntax.  To actually fontify
those constructs, set the variable ‘org-highlight-latex-and-related’ to
the desired list of values (per its doc string).  For example:

     (setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex script))

   Remember to use ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on dimmerel,  Next: Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode,  Prev: Note on inline Latex in Org buffers,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.6 Note on dimmer.el
=====================

The ‘dimmer.el’ library by Neil Okamoto can be configured to
automatically dim the colors of inactive Emacs windows.  To guarantee
consistent results with the Modus themes, we suggest some tweaks to the
default styles, such as in this minimal setup:

     (use-package dimmer
       :config
       (setq dimmer-fraction 0.3)
       (setq dimmer-adjustment-mode :foreground)
       (setq dimmer-use-colorspace :rgb)

       (dimmer-mode 1))

   Of the above, we strongly recommend the RGB color space because it is
the one that remains faithful to the hueness of the colors used by the
themes.  Whereas the default CIELAB space has a tendency to distort
colors in addition to applying the dim effect, which can be somewhat
disorienting.

   The value of the ‘dimmer-fraction’ has been selected empirically.
Users might prefer to tweak it further (increasing it makes the dim
effect more pronounced).

   Changing the ‘dimmer-adjustment-mode’ is a matter of preference.
Though because the Modus themes use black and white as their base
colors, any other value for that variable will turn the main background
gray.  This inadvertently leads to the opposite of the intended utility
of this package: it draws too much attention to unfocused windows.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode,  Next: Note on highlight-parenthesesel,  Prev: Note on dimmerel,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.7 Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode
==============================================

The ‘display-fill-column-indicator-mode’ uses a typographic character to
draw its line.  This has the downside of creating a dashed line.  The
dashes are further apart depending on how tall the font’s glyph height
is and what integer the ‘line-spacing’ is set to.

   At the theme level we eliminate this effect by making the character
one pixel tall: the line is contiguous.  Users who prefer the dashed
line are advised to change the ‘fill-column-indicator’ face, as
explained elsewhere in this document.  For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(fill-column-indicator ((,class :foreground ,bg-active)))))

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

   To make the line thicker, set the height to be equal to the base font
size instead of the one pixel we use.  This is done by specifying a rate
instead of an absolute number, as in ‘:height 1.0’ versus ‘:height 1’.
For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(fill-column-indicator ((,class :height 1.0 :background ,bg-inactive :foreground ,bg-inactive)))))

7.8 Note on highlight-parentheses.el
====================================

The ‘highlight-parentheses’ package provides contextual coloration of
surrounding parentheses, highlighting only those which are around the
point.  The package expects users to customize the applicable colors on
their own by configuring certain variables.

   To make the Modus themes work as expected with this, we need to use
some of the techniques that are discussed at length in the various
“Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) sections, which provide insight into the more
advanced customization options of the themes.

   *note Advanced customization::.

   In the following example, we are assuming that the user wants to (i)
re-use color variables provided by the themes, (ii) be able to retain
their tweaks while switching between ‘modus-operandi’ and
‘modus-vivendi’, and (iii) have the option to highlight either the
foreground of the parentheses or the background as well.

   We start by defining our own variable, which will serve as a toggle
between foreground and background coloration styles:

     (defvar my-highlight-parentheses-use-background t
       "Prefer `highlight-parentheses-background-colors'.")

   Then we can update our preference with this:

     ;; Set to nil to disable backgrounds.
     (setq my-highlight-parentheses-use-background nil)

   To re-use colors from the themes, we must wrap our code in the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro.  Our implementation must interface
with the variables ‘highlight-parentheses-background-colors’ and/or
‘highlight-parentheses-colors’.

   So we can have something like this (the doc string of
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ explains where the names of the colors can be
found):

     (modus-themes-with-colors
         ;; Our preference for setting either background or foreground
         ;; styles, depending on `my-highlight-parentheses-use-background'.
         (if my-highlight-parentheses-use-background

             ;; Here we set color combinations that involve both a background
             ;; and a foreground value.
             (setq highlight-parentheses-background-colors (list cyan-refine-bg

7.9 Note on mmm-mode.el background colors
=========================================

The faces used by ‘mmm-mode.el’ are expected to have a colorful
background, while they should not touch any foreground value.  The idea
is that they must not interfere with existing fontification.  Those
background colors need to be distinct from each other, such as an
unambiguous red juxtaposed with a clear blue.

   While this design may be internally consistent with the raison d’être
of that library, it inevitably produces inaccessible color combinations.

   There are two competing goals at play:

  1. Legibility of the text, understood as the contrast ratio between
     the background and the foreground.

  2. Semantic precision of each face which entails faithfulness to
     color-coding of the underlying background.

   As the Modus themes are designed with the express purpose of
conforming with the first point, we have to forgo the apparent
color-coding of the background elements.  Instead we use subtle colors
that do not undermine the legibility of the affected text while they
still offer a sense of added context.

   Users who might prefer to fall below the minimum 7:1 contrast ratio
in relative luminance (the accessibility target we conform with), can
opt to configure the relevant faces on their own.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette::.

   This example uses more vivid background colors, though it comes at
the very high cost of degraded legibility.

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(mmm-cleanup-submode-face ((,class :background ,yellow-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-code-submode-face ((,class :background ,bg-active)))

7.10 Note on prism.el
=====================

This package by Adam Porter, aka “alphapapa” or “github-alphapapa”,
implements an alternative to the typical coloration of code.  Instead of
highlighting the syntactic constructs, it applies color to different
levels of depth in the code structure.

   As ‘prism.el’ offers a broad range of customizations, we cannot style
it directly at the theme level: that would run contrary to the spirit of
the package.  Instead, we may offer preset color schemes.  Those should
offer a starting point for users to adapt to their needs.

   In the following code snippets, we employ the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro: *note Face specs at scale using the
themes' palette::.

   These are the minimum recommended settings with 16 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 16)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       magenta
                       cyan-alt-other
                       magenta-alt-other
                       blue
                       magenta-alt
                       cyan-alt
                       red-alt-other
                       green
                       fg-main
                       cyan
                       yellow
                       blue-alt
                       red-alt
                       green-alt-other
                       fg-special-warm)))

   With 8 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 8)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list blue
                       magenta
                       magenta-alt-other
                       cyan-alt-other
                       fg-main
                       blue-alt
                       red-alt-other
                       cyan)))

   And this is with 4 colors, which produces results that are the
closest to the themes’ default aesthetic:

     (setq prism-num-faces 4)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list blue
                       magenta
                       magenta-alt-other
                       green-alt)))

   If you need to apply desaturation and lightening, you can use what
the ‘prism.el’ documentation recommends, like this (adapting to the
examples with the 4, 8, 16 colors):

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :lightens (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       cyan-alt-other
                       magenta-alt-other
                       magenta)))

7.11 Note on god-mode.el
========================

The ‘god-mode’ library does not provide faces that could be configured
by the Modus themes.  Users who would like to get some visual feedback
on the status of ‘M-x god-mode’ are instead encouraged by upstream to
set up their own configurations, such as by changing the ‘mode-line’
face (*note Advanced customization::).  This is an adaptation of the
approach followed in the upstream README:

     (defun my-god-mode-update-mode-line ()
       "Make `mode-line' blue if God local mode is active."
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (if god-local-mode
             (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil
                                 :foreground blue-active
                                 :background bg-active-accent
                                 :box blue)
           (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil
                               :foreground fg-active
                               :background bg-active
                               :box fg-alt))))

     (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'my-god-mode-update-mode-line)

   We employ the ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ which provides access to
color variables defined by the active theme.  Its use is covered
elsewhere in this manual (*note Face specs at scale using the themes'
palette::).  As for the attributes that can be passed to each face,
start by consulting the documentation string of ‘set-face-attribute’.

7.12 Note on company-mode overlay pop-up
========================================

By default, the ‘company-mode’ pop-up that lists completion candidates
is drawn using an overlay.  This creates alignment issues every time it
is placed above a piece of text that has a different height than the
default.

   The solution recommended by the project’s maintainer is to use an
alternative front-end for drawing the pop-up which draws child frames
instead of overlays.(1)(2)

7.13 Note on ERC escaped color sequences
========================================

The built-in IRC client ‘erc’ has the ability to colorise any text using
escape sequences that start with ‘^C’ (inserted with ‘C-q C-c’) and are
followed by a number for the foreground and background.(1)  Possible
numbers are 0-15, with the first entry being the foreground and the
second the background, separated by a comma.  Like this ‘^C1,6’.  The
minimum setup is this:

     (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'irccontrols)
     (setq erc-interpret-controls-p t
           erc-interpret-mirc-color t)

   As this allows users the chance to make arbitrary combinations, it is
impossible to guarantee a consistently high contrast ratio.  All we can
we do is provide guidance on the combinations that satisfy the
accessibility standard of the themes:

Modus Operandi
     Use foreground color 1 for all backgrounds from 2-15.  Like so:
     ‘C-q C-c1’ where ‘N’ is the background.

Modus Vivendi
     Use foreground color 0 for all backgrounds from 2-13.  Use
     foreground ‘1’ for backgrounds 14, 15.

   Colors 0 and 1 are white and black respectively.  So combine them
together, if you must.

7.16 Note on SHR fonts
======================

By default, packages that build on top of the Simple HTML Remember

user option ‘shr-use-fonts’, which is set to non-nil by default.  To use
the standard font instead, set that variable to nil.

7.17 Note on Ement colors and fonts
===================================

The ‘ement.el’ library by Adam Porter (also known as “alphapapa”)
defaults to a method of colorizing usernames in a rainbow style.  This
is controlled by the user option ‘ement-room-prism’ and can be disabled
with:

     (setq ement-room-prism nil)

   The contrast ratio of these colors is governed by another user
option: ‘ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast’.  By default, it is set to 6
which is slightly below our nominal target.  Try this instead:

     (setq ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast 7)

   With regard to fonts, Ement depends on ‘shr’ (*note Note on SHR
fonts::).

   Since we are here, here is an excerpt from Ement’s source code:

     (defcustom ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast 6
       "Attempt to enforce this minimum contrast ratio for user faces.
     This should be a reasonable number from, e.g. 0-7 or so."
       ;; Prot would almost approve of this default.  :) I would go all the way
       ;; to 7, but 6 already significantly dilutes the colors in some cases.
       :type 'number)

   Yes, I do approve of that default.  Even a 4.5 (the WCAG AA rating)
would be a good baseline for many themes and/or user configurations.
Our target is the highest of the sort, though we do not demand that
everyone conforms with it.

7.18 Note on Helm grep
======================

There is one face from the Helm package that is meant to highlight the
matches of a grep or grep-like command (‘ag’ or ‘ripgrep’).  It is
‘helm-grep-match’.  However, this face can only apply when the user does
not pass ‘--color=always’ as a command-line option for their command.

   Here is the docstring for that face, which is defined in the
‘helm-grep.el’ library (you can always visit the source code with ‘M-x
find-library’).

     Face used to highlight grep matches.  Have no effect when grep
     backend use “–color=”

   The user must either remove ‘--color’ from the flags passed to the
grep function, or explicitly use ‘--color=never’ (or equivalent).  Helm
provides user-facing customization options for controlling the grep
function’s parameters, such as ‘helm-grep-default-command’ and
‘helm-grep-git-grep-command’.

   When ‘--color=always’ is in effect, the grep output will use red text
in bold letter forms to present the matching part in the list of
candidates.  That style still meets the contrast ratio target of >= 7:1
(accessibility standard WCAG AAA), because it draws the reference to
ANSI color number 1 (red) from the already-supported array of
‘ansi-color-names-vector’.

7.19 Note on pdf-tools link hints
=================================

Hints are drawn by ImageMagick (https://imagemagick.org/), not Emacs,
i.e., ImageMagick doesn’t know about the hint face unless you tell
ImageMagick about it.  By default, only the foreground and background
color attributes are passed.  The below snippet adds to those the
various font attributes.  As it queries various faces, specifically
‘pdf-links-read-link’ and the faces it inherits, it needs to be added to
your initialization file after you’ve customized any faces.

7.20 Note on the Notmuch logo
=============================

By default, the “hello” buffer of Notmuch includes a header with the
programs’ logo and a couple of buttons.  The logo has the effect of
enlarging the height of the line, which negatively impacts the shape of
those buttons.  Disabling the logo fixes the problem:

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?,  Next: What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

8.1 Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?
================================================

The minimum contrast ratio in relative luminance that the themes conform
with always refers to any given combination of background and foreground
colors.  If we have some blue colored text next to a magenta one, both
against a white background, we do not mean to imply that blue:magenta is
7:1 in terms of relative luminance.  Rather, we state that blue:white
and magenta:white each are 7:1 or higher.

   The point of reference is always the background.  Because colors have
about the same minimum distance in luminance from their backdrop, they
necessarily are fairly close to each other in this measure.  A possible
blue:magenta combination would naturally be around 1:1 in contrast of
the sort here considered.

   To differentiate between sequential colors, we rely on hueness by
mapping contrasting hues to adjacent constructs, while avoiding
exaggerations.  A blue next to a magenta can be told apart regardless of
their respective contrast ratio against their common background.
Exceptions would be tiny characters in arguably not so realistic cases,
such as two dots drawn side-by-side which for some reason would need to
be colored differently.  They would still be legible though, which is
the primary objective of the Modus themes.

8.2 What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?
=============================================

The Modus themes are designed with restraint, so that their default
looks do not overdo it with the application of color.

   *note Customization Options::.

   This is the non-quantifiable aspect of the themes’ design: the
artistic part, if you will.  There are a lot of cases where color can be
used inconsiderately, without accounting for layout, typographic, or
other properties of the presentation.  For example, two headings with
distinct markers, such as leading asterisks in Org buffers, do not have
to have highly contrasting hues between them in order to be told apart:
the added element of contrast in hueness does not contribute
significantly more to the distinction between the headings than colors
whose hues are relatively closer to each other in the color space.

   Exaggerations can be hard to anticipate or identify.  Multiple shades
of blue and magenta in the same context may not seem optimal: one might
think that it would be better to use highly contrasting hues to ensure
that all colors stand out, such as by placing blue next to yellow, next
to magenta, and green.  That would, however, be a case of design for its
own sake; a case where color is being applied without consideration of
its end results in the given context.  Too many contrasting hues in
close proximity force an erratic rate to how the eye jumps from one
piece of text to the next.  Whereas multiple shades of, say, blue and
magenta can suffice to tell things apart and avoid excess coloration: a
harmonious rhythm.

8.3 Why are colors mostly variants of blue, magenta, cyan?
==========================================================

Due to the innate properties of color, some options are better than
others for the accessibility purposes of the themes, the stylistic
consistency between ‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’, and the
avoidance of exaggerations in design.

   *note What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?::

   What we describe as color is a function of three distinct channels of
light: red, green, blue.  In hexadecimal RGB notation, a color value is
read as three pairs of red, green, and blue light: ‘#RRGGBB’.  Of those
three, the most luminant is green, while the least luminant is blue.

   The three basic colors represent each of the channels of light.  They
can be intermixed to give us six colors: red and green derive yellow,
green and blue make cyan, red and blue turn into magenta.

   We can test the luminance of each of those against white and black to
get a sense of how not all colors are equally good for accessibility
(white is ‘#ffffff’, which means that all three light channels are fully
luminated, while black is ‘#000000’ meaning that no light is present
(notwithstanding display technology)).

     | Name    |         | #ffffff | #000000 |
     |---------+---------+---------+---------|
     | red     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |    5.25 |
     | yellow  | #ffff00 |    1.07 |   19.56 |
     | green   | #00ff00 |    1.37 |   15.30 |
     | cyan    | #00ffff |    1.25 |   16.75 |
     | blue    | #0000ff |    8.59 |    2.44 |
     | magenta | #ff00ff |    3.14 |    6.70 |

   *note Measure color contrast::.

   By reading this table we learn that every color that has a high level
of green light (green, yellow, cyan) is virtually unreadable against a
white background and, conversely, can be easily read against black.

   We can then infer that red and blue, in different combinations, with
green acting as calibrator for luminance, will give us fairly moderate
colors that pass the 7:1 target.  Blue with a bit of green produce
appropriate variants of cyan.  Similarly, blue combined with some red
and hints of green give us suitable shades of purple.

   Due to the need of maintaining some difference in hueness between
adjacent colors, it is not possible to make red, green, and yellow the
main colors, because blue cannot be used to control their luminance and,
thus the relevant space will shrink considerably.

   *note Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?::

   This phenomenon is best illustrated by the following table that
measures the relative luminance of shades of red, yellow, magenta
against white:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #990000 |    8.92 |
     | #995500 |    5.75 |
     | #990099 |    7.46 |

   We notice that equal values of red and blue light in ‘#990099’
(magenta shade) do not lead to a considerable change in luminance
compared with ‘#990000’ (red variant).  Whereas less amount of green
light in ‘#995500’ leads to a major drop in luminance relative to white.
It follows that using the green channel of light to calibrate the
luminance of colors is more effective than trying to do the same with
either red or blue (the latter is the least effective in that regard).

   When we need to work with several colors, it is always better to have
sufficient manoeuvring space, especially since we cannot pick arbitrary
colors but only those that satisfy the accessibility objectives of the
themes.

   As for why we do not mostly use green, yellow, cyan for the dark
theme, it is because those colors are far more luminant than their
counterparts on the other side of the spectrum, so to ensure that they
all have about the same contrast ratios we would have to alter their
hueness considerably.  In short, the effect would not be optimal as it
would lead to exaggerations.  Plus, it would make ‘modus-vivendi’ look
completely different than ‘modus-operandi’, to the effect that the two
could not be properly considered part of the same project.

8.4 What is the best setup for legibility?
==========================================

The Modus themes can be conceptually simplified as combinations of color
values that account for relative luminance and inner harmony.  Those
qualities do not guarantee that every end-user will have the same
experience, due to differences between people, but also because of
variances in hardware capabilities and configurations.  For the purposes
of this document, we may only provide suggestions pertaining to the
latter case.

   ‘modus-operandi’ is best used outdoors or in a room that either gets
direct sunlight or has plenty of light.  Whereas ‘modus-vivendi’ works
better when there is not a lot of sunshine or the room has a source of
light that is preferably a faint and/or warm one.  It is possible to use
‘modus-operandi’ at night and ‘modus-vivendi’ during the day, though
that will depend on several variables, such as one’s overall perception
of color, the paint on the walls and how that contributes to the
impression of lightness in the room, the sense of space within the eye’s
peripheral vision, hardware specifications, and environmental factors.

   In general, an additional source of light other than that of the
monitor can help reduce eye strain: the eyes are more relaxed when they
do not have to focus on one point to gather light.

   The monitor’s display settings must be accounted for.  Gamma values,
in particular, need to be calibrated to neither amplify nor distort the
perception of black.  Same principle for sharpness, brightness, and
contrast as determined by the hardware, which all have an effect on how
text is read on the screen.

   There are software level methods on offer, such as the XrandR utility
for the X Window System (X.org), which can make gamma corrections for
each of the three channels of light (red, green, blue).  For example:

     xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 1.0 --gamma 0.76:0.75:0.68

   Typography is another variable.  Some font families are blurry at
small point sizes.  Others may have a regular weight that is lighter
(thiner) than that of their peers which may, under certain
circumstances, cause a halo effect around each glyph.

   The gist is that legibility cannot be fully solved at the theme
level.  The color combinations may have been optimized for
accessibility, though the remaining contributing factors in each case
need to be considered in full.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Are these color schemes?,  Next: Port the Modus themes to other platforms?,  Prev: What is the best setup for legibility?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

8.5 Are these color schemes?
============================

No, the Modus themes are not color schemes.

   A color scheme is a collection of colors.  A good color scheme is a
combination of colors with an inner logic or abstract structure.

   A theme is a set of patterns that are applied across different
contexts.  A good theme is one that does so with consistency, though not
uniformity.

   In practical terms, a color scheme is what one uses when, for
example, they edit the first sixteen escape sequences of a terminal
emulator to the hues of their preference.  The terminal offers the
option to choose, say, the exact value of what counts as “red”, but does
not provide the means to control where that is mapped to and whether it
should also have other qualities such as a bold weight for the
underlying text or an added background color.  In contradistinction,
Emacs uses constructs known as “faces” which allow the user/developer to
specify where a given color will be used and whether it should be
accompanied by other typographic or stylistic attributes.

   By configuring the multitude of faces on offer we thus control both
which colors are applied and how they appear in their context.  When a
package wants to render each instance of “foo” with the “bar” face, it
is not requesting a specific color, which makes things considerably more
flexible as we can treat “bar” in its own right without necessarily
having to use some color value that we hardcoded somewhere.

   Which brings us to the distinction between consistency and uniformity
where our goal is always the former: we want things to look similar
across all interfaces, but we must never force a visual identity where
that runs contrary to the functionality of the given interface.  For
instance, all links are underlined by default yet there are cases such
as when viewing listings of emails in Gnus (and Mu4e, Notmuch) where (i)
it is already understood that one must follow the indicator or headline
to view its contents and (ii) underlining everything would make the
interface virtually unusable.

   *note Option for links: Link styles.

   Again, one must exercise judgement in order to avoid discrimination,
where “discrimination” refers to:

   • The treatment of substantially different magnitudes as if they were
     of the same class.
   • Or the treatment of the same class of magnitudes as if they were of
     a different class.

   (To treat similar things differently; to treat dissimilar things
alike.)

   If, in other words, one was to enforce uniformity without accounting
for the particular requirements of each case—the contextual demands for
usability beyond matters of color—they would be making a not-so-obvious
error of treating different cases as if they were the same.

   The Modus themes prioritise “thematic consistency” over abstract
harmony or regularity among their applicable colors.  In concrete terms,
we do not claim that, say, our yellows are the best complements for our
blues because we generally avoid using complementary colors
side-by-side, so it is wrong to optimise for a decontextualised
blue+yellow combination.  Not to imply that our colors do not work well
together because they do, just to clarify that consistency of context is
what themes must strive for, and that requires widening the scope of the
design beyond the particularities of a color scheme.

   Long story short: color schemes and themes have different
requirements.  Please do not conflate the two.

8.6 Port the Modus themes to other platforms?
=============================================

There is no plan to port the themes to other platforms or text editors.
I (Protesilaos) only use GNU Emacs and thus cannot maintain code that
targets software I am either not familiar with or am not using on a
daily basis.

   While it is possible to produce a simulacrum based on a given
template, doing so would run contrary to how this project is maintained
where details matter greatly.

   Each program has its own requirements so it won’t always be
possible—or indeed desirable—to have 1:1 correspondence between what
applies to Emacs and what should be done elsewhere.  No port should ever
strive to be a faithful copy of the Emacs implementation, as no other
program is an Emacs equivalent, but instead try to follow the spirit of
the design.  For example, some of the customization options accept a
list as their value, or an alist, which may not be possible to reproduce
on other platforms.

   *note Customization options: Customization Options.

   In other words, if something must be done differently on a certain
editor then that is acceptable so long as (i) the accessibility
standards are not compromised and (ii) the overall character of the
themes remains consistent.

   The former criterion should be crystal clear as it pertains to the
scientific foundations of the themes: high legibility and taking care of
the needs of users with red-green color deficiency (deuteranopia) by
avoiding red+green color coding paradigms and/or by providing red+blue
variants.

   The latter criterion is the “je ne sais quoi” of the artistic aspect
of the themes, which is partially fleshed out in this manual.

   *note Frequently Asked Questions::.

   With regard to the artistic aspect (where “art” qua skill may amount
to an imprecise science), there is no hard-and-fast rule in effect as it
requires one to exercise discretion and make decisions based on
context-dependent information or constraints.  As is true with most
things in life, when in doubt, do not cling on to the letter of the law
but try to understand its spirit.

   For a trivial example: the curly underline that Emacs draws for
spelling errors is thinner than, e.g., what a graphical web browser has,
so if I was to design for an editor than has a thicker curly underline I
would make the applicable colors less intense to counterbalance the
typographic intensity of the added thickness.

   With those granted, if anyone is willing to develop a port of the
themes, they are welcome to contact me and I will do my best to help
them in their efforts.

9.3 Patches require copyright assignment to the FSF
===================================================

Code contributions are most welcome.  For any major edit (more than 15
lines, or so, in aggregate per person), you need to make a copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation.  This is necessary because
the themes are part of the upstream Emacs distribution: the FSF must at
all times be in a position to enforce the GNU General Public License.

   Copyright assignment is a simple process.  Check the request form
below (please adapt it accordingly).  You must write an email to the
address mentioned in the form and then wait for the FSF to send you a
legal agreement.  Sign the document and file it back to them.  This
could all happen via email and take about a week.  You are encouraged to
go through this process.  You only need to do it once.  It will allow
you to make contributions to Emacs in general.

     Please email the following information to assign@gnu.org, and we

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
