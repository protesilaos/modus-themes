1 Overview
**********

The Modus themes are designed for accessible readability.  They conform
with the highest standard for color contrast between combinations of
background and foreground values.  For small sized text, this
corresponds to the WCAG AAA standard, which specifies a minimum rate of
distance in relative luminance of 7:1.

   The Modus themes consist of six themes, divided into three subgroups.

Main themes
     ‘modus-operandi’ is the project’s main light theme, while
     ‘modus-vivendi’ is its dark counterpart.  These two themes are part
     of the project since its inception.  They are designed to cover a
     broad range of needs and are, in the opinion of the author, the
     reference for what a highly legible “default” theme should look
     like.

Tinted themes
     ‘modus-operandi-tinted’ and ‘modus-vivendi-tinted’ are variants of
     the two main themes.  They slightly tone down the intensity of the
     background and provide a bit more color variety.
     ‘modus-operandi-tinted’ has a set of base tones that are shades of
     light ochre (earthly colors), while ‘modus-vivendi-tinted’ gives a
     night sky impression.

Deuteranopia themes
     ‘modus-operandi-deuteranopia’ and its companion
     ‘modus-vivendi-deuteranopia’ are optimized for users with red-green
     color deficiency.  This means that they do not use red and green
     hues for color-coding purposes, such as for diff removed and added
     lines.  Instead, they implement colors that are discernible by
     users with deueteranopia or deuteranomaly (mostly yellow and blue
     hues).

   To ensure that users have a consistently accessible experience, the
themes strive to achieve as close to full face coverage as possible,
while still targeting a curated list of well-maintained packages (*note
Face coverage::).

   The overarching objective of this project is to always offer
accessible color combinations.  There shall never be a compromise on
this principle.  If there arises an inescapable trade-off between
readability and stylistic considerations, we will always opt for the
former.

   Starting with version 0.12.0 and onwards, the themes are built into
GNU Emacs.

2 Installation
**************

The Modus themes are distributed with Emacs starting with version 28.1.
On older versions of Emacs, they can be installed using Emacs’ package
manager or manually from their code repository.  There also exist
packages for distributions of GNU/Linux.

   Emacs 28 ships with ‘modus-themes’ version ‘1.6.0’.  Emacs 29
includes version ‘3.0.0’.  Emacs 30 provides a newer, refactored version
that thoroughly refashions how the themes are implemented and
customized.  Such major versions are not backward-compatible due to the
limited resources at the maintainer’s disposal to support multiple
versions of Emacs and of the themes across the years.

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install manually from source,  Next: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.1 Install manually from source
================================

In the following example, we are assuming that your Emacs files are
stored in ‘~/.emacs.d’ and that you want to place the Modus themes in
‘~/.emacs.d/modus-themes’.

  1. Get the source and store it in the desired path by running the
     following in the command line shell:

     $ git clone https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes.git ~/.emacs.d/modus-themes

  1. Add that path to your known Elisp libraries’ list, by placing this
     snippet of Emacs Lisp in your init file (e.g.  ‘init.el’):

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/modus-themes")

   The themes are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install from the archives,  Next: Install on GNU/Linux,  Prev: Install manually from source,  Up: Installation

2.2 Install from the archives
=============================

The ‘modus-themes’ package is available from the GNU ELPA archive, which
is configured by default.

   Prior to querying any package archive, make sure to update the index,
with ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’.  Then all you need to do is type
‘M-x package-install’ and specify the ‘modus-themes’.

   Once installed, the themes are ready to be used: *note Enable and
load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install on GNU/Linux,  Next: Dealing with byte compilation errors,  Prev: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.3 Install on GNU/Linux
========================

The themes are also available from the archives of some distributions of
GNU/Linux.  These should correspond to a tagged release rather than
building directly from the latest Git commit.  It all depends on the
distro’s packaging policies.

2.3.1 Debian 11 Bullseye
------------------------

The themes are part of Debian 11 Bullseye.  Get them with:

     sudo apt install elpa-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.

   NOTE that Debian’s package is severely out-of-date as of this writing
2022-07-24 09:57 +0300.

2.3.2 GNU Guix
--------------

Users of Guix can get the themes with this command:

     guix package -i emacs-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Dealing with byte compilation errors,  Prev: Install on GNU/Linux,  Up: Installation

2.4 Dealing with byte compilation errors
========================================

From time to time, we receive bug reports pertaining to errors with byte
compilation.  These seldom have to do with faulty code in the themes: it
might be a shortcoming of ‘package.el’, some regression in the current
development target of Emacs, a misconfiguration in an otherwise exotic
setup, and the like.

   The common solution with a stable version of Emacs is to:

  1. Delete the ‘modus-themes’ package.
  2. Close the current Emacs session.
  3. Install the ‘modus-themes’ again.

   For those building Emacs directly from source, the solution may
involve reverting to an earlier commit in emacs.git.

   At any rate, if you encounter such an issue please report it: we will
either fix the bug on our end if it is truly ours, or help forward it to
the relevant upstream maintainer.  Whatever you do, please understand
that a build failure does not mean we are necessarily doing something
wrong.

   *note Issues you can help with::.

3 Enable and load
*****************

NOTE that Emacs can load multiple themes, which typically produces
undesirable results and undoes the work of the designer.  Use the
‘disable-theme’ command if you are trying other themes beside the Modus
collection (*note Option for disabling other themes while loading Modus:
Disable other themes.).

   Users of the built-in themes cannot ‘require’ the package as usual
because there is no package to speak of.  Instead, things are simpler as
built-in themes are considered safe.  All one needs is to load the theme
of their preference by adding either form to their init file:

     (load-theme 'modus-operandi)            ; Light theme
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)             ; Dark theme

   Remember that the Modus themes are six themes (*note Overview::).
Adapt the above snippet accordingly.

   Users of packaged variants of the themes must add a few more lines to
ensure that everything works as intended.  First, one has to require the
main library before loading one of the themes:

     (require 'modus-themes)

   One can activate a theme with something like the following
expression, replacing ‘modus-operandi’ with their preferred Modus theme:

     (load-theme 'modus-operandi :no-confirm)

   Changes to the available customization options must always be
evaluated before loading a theme (*note Customization Options:
Customization options.).  Reload a theme for new changes to take effect.

   This is how a basic setup could look like (*note The require-theme
for built-in Emacs themes: The require-theme for built-in Emacs
themes.):

     ;;; For the built-in themes which cannot use `require'.
     (require-theme 'modus-themes)

     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes.
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil)

     ;; Load the theme of your choice.
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi)

     ;; Optionally define a key to switch between Modus themes.  Also check
     ;; the user option `modus-themes-to-toggle'.
     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)



     ;;; For packaged versions which must use `require'.

     (require 'modus-themes)

     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil)

     ;; Load the theme of your choice.
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi :no-confirm)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)

3.1 The ‘require-theme’ for built-in Emacs themes
=================================================

The version of the Modus themes that is included in Emacs CANNOT use the
standard ‘require’.  This is because the built-in themes are not
included in the ‘load-path’ (not my decision).  The ‘require-theme’
function must be used in this case as a replacement.  For example:

     (require-theme 'modus-themes)

     ;; All customizations here
     (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs t
           modus-themes-italic-constructs t)

     ;; Maybe define some palette overrides, such as by using our presets
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense)

     ;; Load the theme of choice (built-in themes are always "safe" so they
     ;; do not need the `no-require' argument of `load-theme').
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Sample configuration with and without use-package,  Next: Differences between loading and enabling,  Prev: The require-theme for built-in Emacs themes,  Up: Enable and load

3.2 Sample configuration with and without use-package
=====================================================

What follows is a variant of what we demonstrate in the previous section
(*note Enable and load::).

   It is common for Emacs users to rely on ‘use-package’ for declaring
package configurations in their setup.  We use this as an example:

     ;;; For the built-in themes which cannot use `require'.
     (use-package emacs
       :config
       (require-theme 'modus-themes) ; `require-theme' is ONLY for the built-in Modus themes

       ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
       (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
             modus-themes-bold-constructs nil)

       ;; Maybe define some palette overrides, such as by using our presets
       (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
             modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense)

       ;; Load the theme of your choice.
       (load-theme 'modus-operandi)
       :bind ("<f5>" . modus-themes-toggle))



     ;;; For packaged versions which must use `require'.
     (use-package modus-themes
       :ensure t
       :demand t
       :config
       ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
       (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
             modus-themes-bold-constructs nil)

       ;; Maybe define some palette overrides, such as by using our presets
       (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
             modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense)

       ;; Load the theme of your choice.
       (load-theme 'modus-operandi :no-confirm)
       :bind ("<f5>" . modus-themes-toggle))

   The same without ‘use-package’:

     (require 'modus-themes) ; OR for the built-in themes: (require-theme 'modus-themes)

     ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
     (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t
           modus-themes-bold-constructs nil)

     ;; Maybe define some palette overrides, such as by using our presets
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense)

     ;; Load the theme of your choice:
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi :no-confirm)

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)

   *note Differences between loading and enabling::.

   Note: make sure not to customize the variable
‘custom-theme-load-path’ or ‘custom-theme-directory’ after the themes’
package declaration.  That will lead to failures in loading the files.
If either or both of those variables need to be changed, their values
should be defined before the package declaration of the themes.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Differences between loading and enabling,  Prev: Sample configuration with and without use-package,  Up: Enable and load

3.3 Differences between loading and enabling
============================================

The reason we recommend ‘load-theme’ instead of the other option of
‘enable-theme’ is that the former does a kind of “reset” on the face
specs.  It quite literally loads (or reloads) the theme.  Whereas the
‘enable-theme’ function simply puts an already loaded theme to the top
of the list of enabled items, re-using whatever state was last loaded.

   As such, ‘load-theme’ reads all customizations that may happen during
any given Emacs session: even after the initial setup of a theme.
Examples are calls to ‘custom-set-faces’, as well as new values assigned
to the options the Modus themes provide (*note Customization Options:
Customization options.).

   Our tests show that ‘enable-theme’ does not read such variables anew,
so it might appear to the unsuspecting user that the themes are somehow
broken whenever they try to assign a new value to a customization option
or some face.

   This “reset” that ‘load-theme’ brings about does, however, come at
the cost of being somewhat slower than ‘enable-theme’.  Users who have a
stable setup and who seldom update their variables during a given Emacs
session, are better off using something like this:

     (require 'modus-themes)

     ;; Activate your desired themes here
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi t t)
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t t)

     ;; Enable the preferred one
     (enable-theme 'modus-operandi)

   *note Toggle themes without reloading them::.

   *note Sample configuration with and without use-package::.

   With the above granted, other sections of the manual discuss how to
configure custom faces, where ‘load-theme’ is expected, though
‘enable-theme’ could still apply in stable setups:

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

4 Customization options
***********************

The Modus themes are highly configurable, though they should work well
without any further tweaks.  We provide a variety of user options.  The
following code block provides an overview.  In addition to those
variables, the themes support a comprehensive system of overrides: it
can be used to make thoroughgoing changes to the looks of the themes
(*note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.).  We document
everything at length in the pages of this manual and also provide
ready-to-use code samples.

   Remember that all customization options must be evaluated before
loading a theme (*note Enable and load::).  If the theme is already
active, it must be reloaded for changes to take effect.

     ;; `light', `bold', or anything mentioned in `modus-themes-weights'.

4.1 Option for reloading the theme on custom change
===================================================

Brief: Toggle reloading of the active theme when an option is changed
through the Custom UI.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-custom-auto-reload’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’
  2. ‘t’ (default)

   All theme user options take effect when a theme is loaded.  Any
subsequent changes require the theme to be reloaded.

   When this variable has a non-nil value, any change made via the
Custom UI or related functions such as ‘customize-set-variable’ and
‘setopt’ (Emacs 29), will trigger a reload automatically.

   With a nil value, changes to user options have no further
consequences: the user must manually reload the theme (*note Enable and
load::).

4.2 Option for disabling other themes while loading Modus
=========================================================

[ Part of 4.1.0-dev.  ]

   Brief: Disable all other themes when loading a Modus theme.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-disable-other-themes’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’
  2. ‘t’ (default)

   When the value is non-nil, the commands ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and
‘modus-themes-select’, as well as the ‘modus-themes-load-theme’
function, will disable all other themes while loading the specified
Modus theme.  This is done to ensure that Emacs does not blend two or
more themes: such blends lead to awkward results that undermine the work
of the designer.

   When the value is nil, the aforementioned commands and function will
only disable other themes within the Modus collection.

   This option is provided because Emacs themes are not necessarily
limited to colors/faces: they can consist of an arbitrary set of
customizations.  Users who use such customization bundles must set this
variable to a nil value.

4.3 Option for more bold constructs
===================================

Brief: Use bold for code syntax highlighting and related.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-bold-constructs’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to use a bold typographic weight only when it is
required.

   With a non-‘nil’ value (‘t’) display several syntactic constructs in
bold weight.  This concerns keywords and other important aspects of code
syntax.  It also affects certain mode line indicators and command
prompts.

   Advanced users may also want to configure the exact attributes of the
‘bold’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

4.4 Option for more italic constructs
=====================================

Brief: Use italics for code syntax highlighting and related.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-italic-constructs’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to not use slanted text forms (italics) unless it is
absolutely necessary.

   With a non-‘nil’ value (‘t’) choose to render more faces in italics.
This typically affects documentation strings and code comments.

   Advanced users may also want to configure the exact attributes of the
‘italic’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

4.5 Option for font mixing
==========================

Brief: Toggle the use of monospaced fonts for spacing-sensitive
constructs (affects font families).

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mixed-fonts’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   When set to non-‘nil’ (‘t’), configure some spacing-sensitive faces
like Org tables and code blocks to always inherit from the ‘fixed-pitch’
face.  This is to ensure that certain constructs like code blocks and
tables remain monospaced even when users opt for a mode that remaps
typeface families, such as the built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’.
Otherwise the layout can appear broken, due to how spacing is done.

   For a consistent experience, user may need to specify the font family
of the ‘fixed-pitch’ face.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Command prompts,  Next: Completion UIs,  Prev: Mixed fonts,  Up: Customization options

4.6 Option for command prompt styles
====================================

Brief: Control the style of command prompts (e.g.  minibuffer, shell,
IRC clients).

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-prompts’ (‘choice’ type, list of properties)

   Possible values are expressed as a list of properties (default is
‘nil’ or an empty list).  The list can include any of the following
symbols:

   • ‘italic’
   • ‘italic’
   • A font weight, which must be supported by the underlying typeface:
        • ‘thin’
        • ‘ultralight’
        • ‘extralight’
        • ‘light’
        • ‘semilight’
        • ‘regular’
        • ‘medium’
        • ‘semibold’
        • ‘bold’
        • ‘heavy’
        • ‘extrabold’
        • ‘ultrabold’

   The default (a ‘nil’ value or an empty list) means to only use a
subtle colored foreground color.

   The ‘italic’ property adds a slant to the font’s forms (italic or
oblique forms, depending on the typeface).

   The symbol of a font weight attribute such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’, et
cetera, adds the given weight to links.  Valid symbols are defined in
the variable ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a weight means that
the one of the underlying text will be used.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (bold italic)
     (italic semibold)

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-prompts '(extrabold italic))

   *note Make prompts more or less colorful::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Completion UIs,  Next: Org mode blocks,  Prev: Command prompts,  Up: Customization options

4.7 Option for completion framework aesthetics
==============================================

Brief: Set the overall style of completion framework interfaces.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-completions’ (‘alist’ type properties)

   This affects Company, Corfu, Flx, Icomplete/Fido, Ido, Ivy,
Orderless, Vertico, and the standard ‘*Completions*’ buffer.  The value
is an alist of expressions, each of which takes the form of ‘(KEY .
LIST-OF-PROPERTIES)’.  ‘KEY’ is a symbol, while ‘PROPERTIES’ is a list.
Here is a sample, followed by a description of the particularities:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((matches . (extrabold underline))
             (selection . (semibold italic))))

   The ‘matches’ key refers to the highlighted characters that
correspond to the user’s input.  When its properties are nil or an empty
list, matching characters in the user interface will have a bold weight
and a colored foreground.  The list of properties may include any of the
following symbols regardless of the order they may appear in:

   • ‘underline’ to draw a line below the characters;

   • ‘italic’ to use a slanted font (italic or oblique forms);

   • The symbol of a font weight attribute such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’,
     et cetera.  Valid symbols are defined in the variable
     ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a weight means that bold
     will be used.

   The ‘selection’ key applies to the current line or currently matched
candidate, depending on the specifics of the user interface.  When its
properties are nil or an empty list, it has a subtle gray background, a
bold weight, and the base foreground value for the text.  The list of
properties it accepts is as follows (order is not significant):

   • ‘underline’ to draw a line below the characters;

   • ‘italic’ to use a slanted font (italic or oblique forms);

   • The symbol of a font weight attribute such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’,
     et cetera.  Valid symbols are defined in the variable
     ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a weight means that bold
     will be used.

   Apart from specifying each key separately, a catch-all list is
accepted.  This is only useful when the desired aesthetic is the same
across all keys that are not explicitly referenced.  For example, this:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((t . (extrabold underline))))

   Is the same as:

     (setq modus-themes-completions
           '((matches . (extrabold underline))
             (selection . (extrabold underline))))

   *note Make completion matches more or less colorful::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Org mode blocks,  Next: Heading styles,  Prev: Completion UIs,  Up: Customization options

4.8 Option for org-mode block styles
====================================

Brief: Set the overall style of Org code blocks, quotes, and the like.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’ (‘choice’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘gray-background’
  3. ‘tinted-background’

   Nil (the default) means that the block has no background of its own:
it uses the one that applies to the rest of the buffer.  In this case,
the delimiter lines have a gray color for their text, making them look
exactly like all other Org properties.

   Option ‘gray-background’ applies a subtle gray background to the
block’s contents.  It also affects the begin and end lines of the block
as they get another shade of gray as their background, which
differentiates them from the contents of the block.  All background
colors extend to the edge of the window, giving the area a rectangular,
“blocky” presentation.  If the begin/end lines do not extend in this
way, check the value of the Org user option
‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’.

   Option ‘tinted-background’ uses a colored background for the contents
of the block.  The exact color value will depend on the programming
language and is controlled by the variable ‘org-src-block-faces’ (refer
to the theme’s source code for the current association list).  For this
to take effect, the Org buffer needs to be restarted with
‘org-mode-restart’.

   Code blocks use their major mode’s fontification (syntax
highlighting) only when the variable ‘org-src-fontify-natively’ is
non-nil.  While quote/verse blocks require setting
‘org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks’ to a non-nil value.

   *note Update Org block delimiter fontification::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Heading styles,  Next: UI typeface,  Prev: Org mode blocks,  Up: Customization options

4.9 Option for the headings’ overall style
==========================================

Brief: Heading styles with optional list of values per heading level.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-headings’ (‘alist’ type, multiple properties)

   This is an alist that accepts a ‘(KEY . LIST-OF-VALUES)’ combination.
The ‘KEY’ is either a number, representing the heading’s level (0
through 8) or ‘t’, which pertains to the fallback style.  The named keys
‘agenda-date’ and ‘agenda-structure’ apply to the Org agenda.

   Level 0 is a special heading: it is used for what counts as a
document title or equivalent, such as the ‘#+title’ construct we find in
Org files.  Levels 1-8 are regular headings.

   The ‘LIST-OF-VALUES’ covers symbols that refer to properties, as
described below.  Here is a complete sample with various stylistic
combinations, followed by a presentation of all available properties:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (variable-pitch 1.5))
             (2 . (1.3))
             (agenda-date . (1.3))
             (agenda-structure . (variable-pitch light 1.8))
             (t . (1.1))))

   Properties:

   • A font weight, which must be supported by the underlying typeface:
        • ‘thin’
        • ‘ultralight’
        • ‘extralight’
        • ‘light’
        • ‘semilight’
        • ‘regular’
        • ‘medium’
        • ‘semibold’
        • ‘bold’ (default)
        • ‘heavy’
        • ‘extrabold’
        • ‘ultrabold’
   • A floating point as a height multiple of the default or a cons cell
     in the form of ‘(height . FLOAT)’.

   By default (a ‘nil’ value for this variable), all headings have a
bold typographic weight and use a desaturated text color.

   A ‘variable-pitch’ property changes the font family of the heading to
that of the ‘variable-pitch’ face (normally a proportionately spaced
typeface).

   The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the heading
accordingly, such as ‘light’, ‘semibold’, etc.  Valid symbols are
defined in the variable ‘modus-themes-weights’.  The absence of a weight
means that bold will be used by virtue of inheriting the ‘bold’ face.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   A number, expressed as a floating point (e.g.  1.5), adjusts the
height of the heading to that many times the base font size.  The
default height is the same as 1.0, though it need not be explicitly
stated.  Instead of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the
form of a cons cell like ‘(height . FLOAT)’ or ‘(height FLOAT)’, where
FLOAT is the given number.

   Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like
in these examples:

     (semibold)
     (variable-pitch semibold 1.3)
     (variable-pitch semibold (height 1.3)) ; same as above
     (variable-pitch semibold (height . 1.3)) ; same as above

   The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

   In user configuration files the form may look like this:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (variable-pitch 1.5))
             (2 . (1.3))
             (agenda-date . (1.3))
             (agenda-structure . (variable-pitch light 1.8))
             (t . (1.1))))

   When defining the styles per heading level, it is possible to pass a
non-‘nil’ value (‘t’) instead of a list of properties.  This will retain
the original aesthetic for that level.  For example:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . t)           ; keep the default style
             (2 . (semibold 1.2))
             (t . (rainbow)))) ; style for all other headings

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . (variable-pitch 1.5))
             (2 . (semibold))
             (t . t))) ; default style for all other levels

   Note that the text color of headings, of their background, and
overline can all be set via the overrides.  It is possible to have any
color combination for any heading level (something that could not be
done in older versions of the themes).

   *note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.

   *note Make headings more or less colorful::.

4.10 Option for variable-pitch font in UI elements
==================================================

Brief: Toggle the use of proportionately spaced (‘variable-pitch’) fonts
in the User Interface.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-variable-pitch-ui’ (‘boolean’ type)

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   This option concerns User Interface elements that are under the
direct control of Emacs.  In particular: the mode line, header line, tab
bar, and tab line.

   The default is to use the same font as the rest of Emacs, which
usually is a monospaced family.

   With a non-‘nil’ value (‘t’) apply a proportionately spaced typeface.
This is done by assigning the ‘variable-pitch’ face to the relevant
items.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Palette overrides,  Prev: UI typeface,  Up: Customization options

4.11 Option for palette overrides
=================================

This section describes palette overrides in detail.  For a simpler
alternative, use the presets we provide (*note Palette override
presets::).

   Each Modus theme specifies a color palette that declares named color
values and semantic color mappings:

   • Named colors consist of a symbol and a string that specifies a
     hexadecimal RGB value.  For example: ‘(blue-warmer "#354fcf")’.

   • The semantic color mappings associate an abstract construct with a
     given named color from the palette, like ‘(heading-2
     yellow-faint)’.  Both elements of the list are symbols, though the
     ‘cadr’ (value) can be a string that specifies a color, such as
     ‘(heading-2 "#354fcf")’.

   Both of those subsets can be overridden, thus refashioning the theme.
Overrides are either shared, by being stored in the user option
‘modus-themes-common-palette-overrides’, or they are specific to the
theme they name.  In the latter case, the naming scheme of each palette
variable is ‘THEME-NAME-palette-overrides’, thus yielding:

   • ‘modus-operandi-palette-overrides’

   • ‘modus-operandi-deuteranopia-palette-overrides’

   • ‘modus-operandi-tinted-palette-overrides’

   • ‘modus-vivendi-palette-overrides’

   • ‘modus-vivendi-deuteranopia-palette-overrides’

   • ‘modus-vivendi-tinted-palette-overrides’

   Theme-specific overrides take precedence over the shared ones.  It is
strongly advised that shared overrides do NOT alter color values, as
those will not be appropriate for both dark and light themes.  Common
overrides are best limited to the semantic color mappings as those use
the color value that corresponds to the active theme (e.g.  make the
cursor ‘blue-warmer’ in all themes, whatever the value of ‘blue-warmer’
is in each theme).

   The value of any overrides’ variable must mirror a theme’s palette.
Palette variables are named after their theme as ‘THEME-NAME-palette’.
For example, the ‘modus-operandi-palette’ is like this:

     (defconst modus-operandi-palette
         '(
     ;;; Basic values

           (bg-main     "#ffffff")
           (bg-dim      "#f0f0f0")
           (fg-main     "#000000")

           ;; ...

           (red         "#a60000")
           (red-warmer  "#972500")
           (red-cooler  "#a0132f")
           (red-faint   "#7f0000")
           (red-intense "#d00000")

           ;; ...

     ;;;; Mappings

           ;; ...

           (cursor fg-main)
           (builtin magenta-warmer)
           (comment fg-dim)
           (constant blue-cooler)
           (docstring green-faint)
           (fnname magenta)
           (keyword magenta-cooler)

           ;; ...
           ))

   The ‘modus-operandi-palette-overrides’ targets the entries that need
to be changed.  For example, to make the main foreground colour a dark
gray instead of pure black, use a shade of red for comments, and apply a
cyan hue to keywords:

     (setq modus-operandi-palette-overrides
           '((fg-main "#333333")
             (comment red-faint)
             (keyword cyan-cooler)))

   Changes take effect upon theme reload (*note Custom reload theme::).
Overrides are removed by setting their variable to a ‘nil’ value.

   The common accented foregrounds in each palette follow a predictable
naming scheme: ‘HUE{,-warmer,-cooler,-faint,-intense}’.  ‘HUE’ is one of
the six basic colors: red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan.

   Named colors that are meant to be used as backgrounds contain ‘bg’ in
their name, such as ‘bg-red-intense’.  While special purpose foregrounds
that are meant to be combined with such backgrounds, contain ‘fg’ in
their name, such as ‘fg-removed’ which complements ‘bg-removed’.

   Named colors can be previewed, such as with the command
‘modus-themes-list-colors’ (*note Preview theme colors::).

4.11.1 Palette override presets
-------------------------------

This section shows how to refashion the themes by opting in to the
stylistic presets we provide.  Those presets override the default color
mappings to amplify or tone down the overall coloration of the them.

   To make almost all aspects of the themes less intense, use this:

     ;; Always remember to reload the theme for changes to take effect!
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides modus-themes-preset-overrides-faint)

   With ‘modus-themes-preset-overrides-faint’ the grays are toned down,
gray backgrounds are removed from some contexts, and almost all accent
colors are desaturated.  It makes the themes less attention-grabbing.

   On the opposite end of the stylistic spectrum, we have this

     ;; Always remember to reload the theme for changes to take effect!
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense)

   The ‘modus-themes-preset-overrides-intense’ makes many background
colors accented instead of gray and increases coloration in a number of
places.  Colors stand out more and are made easier to spot.

   Note that the user is not limited to those presets.  The system of
overrides we provide makes it possible to tweak the value of each
individual named color and to change how values are assigned to semantic
color mappings (*note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.).
Subsequent sections provide examples (*note Stylistic variants using
palette overrides::).

   It is also possible to use those presets as a basis and, for example,
add to them code from the subsequent sections of this manual.  This is
the general idea (extra space for didactic purposes):

     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           `(
             ;; From the section "Make the mode line borderless"
             (border-mode-line-active unspecified)
             (border-mode-line-inactive unspecified)

             ;; From the section "Make matching parenthesis more or less intense"
             (bg-paren-match bg-magenta-intense)
             (underline-paren-match fg-main)

             ;; And expand the preset here.  Note that the ,@ works because
             ;; we use the backtick for this list, instead of a straight
             ;; quote.

......................................

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of
the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette overrides::).
To hide the border around the active and inactive mode lines, we need to
set their color to that of the underlying background.

......................................................

This section contains practical examples of overriding the palette of
the themes (*note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.).
Here we demonstrate how to activate background coloration for completion
matches.  We show three different degrees of intensity.

   *note Option for completion framework aesthetics: Completion UIs.

     ;; These overrides are common to all Modus themes.  We also provide

     ;; Add a nuanced background color to completion matches, while keeping
     ;; their foreground intact (foregrounds do not need to be specified in
     ;; this case, but we do it for didactic purposes).
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((fg-completion-match-0 blue)
             (fg-completion-match-1 magenta-warmer)

     ;; Add intense background colors to completion matches and adjust the

             (fg-completion-match-3 fg-main)
             (bg-completion-match-0 bg-blue-intense)
             (bg-completion-match-1 bg-yellow-intense)
             (bg-completion-match-2 bg-cyan-intense)
             (bg-completion-match-3 bg-red-intense)))

     ;; Like the above, but with subtle backgrounds.

             (bg-completion-match-2 bg-cyan-subtle)
             (bg-completion-match-3 bg-red-subtle)))

   Adding to the above, it is possible to, say, reduce the number of
colors to two:

     ;; No backgrounds (like the default) and just use two colors.
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((fg-completion-match-0 blue)
             (fg-completion-match-1 yellow)

             (bg-completion-match-1 unspecified)
             (bg-completion-match-2 unspecified)
             (bg-completion-match-3 unspecified)))

     ;; Again, a two-color style but this time with backgrounds
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((fg-completion-match-0 blue)
             (fg-completion-match-1 yellow)

             (fg-completion-match-3 yellow)
             (bg-completion-match-0 bg-blue-nuanced)
             (bg-completion-match-1 bg-yellow-nuanced)
             (bg-completion-match-2 bg-blue-nuanced)

...............................................

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of
the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette overrides::).
In previous versions of the themes, we provided an option for yellow-ish
comments and green-ish strings.  For some users, those were still not
good enough, as the exact values were hardcoded.  Here we show how to
reproduce the effect, but also how to tweak it to one’s liking.

4.11.2.9 Make code syntax use the old alt-syntax style
......................................................

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of
the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette overrides::).
In this section we show how to reproduce what previous versions of the
Modus themes provided as a stylistic alternative for code syntax.  The
upside of using overrides for this purpose is that we can tweak the
style to our liking, but first let’s start with its recreation:

     ;; These overrides are common to all Modus themes.  We also provide
     ;; theme-specific options, such as `modus-operandi-palette-overrides'.
     ;;
     ;; In general, the theme-specific overrides are better for overriding
     ;; color values, such as redefining what `blue-faint' looks like.  The
     ;; common overrides are best used for changes to semantic color
     ;; mappings, as we show below.


     ;; The old "alt-syntax"
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((builtin magenta)
             (comment fg-dim)
             (constant magenta-cooler)
             (docstring magenta-faint)
             (docmarkup green-faint)
             (fnname magenta-warmer)
             (keyword cyan)
             (preprocessor cyan-cooler)
             (string red-cooler)
             (type magenta-cooler)
             (variable blue-warmer)
             (rx-construct magenta-warmer)
             (rx-backslash blue-cooler)))

   The “alt-syntax” could optionally use green strings and yellow
comments (*note Make comments yellow and strings green::):

     ;; Same as above, but with yellow comments and green strings
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((builtin magenta)
             (comment yellow-faint)
             (constant magenta-cooler)
             (docstring green-faint)
             (docmarkup magenta-faint)
             (fnname magenta-warmer)
             (keyword cyan)
             (preprocessor cyan-cooler)
             (string green-cooler)
             (type magenta-cooler)
             (variable blue-warmer)
             (rx-construct magenta-warmer)
             (rx-backslash blue-cooler)))

   The standard “alt-syntax” has red strings.  As such, it is
interesting to experiment with faintly red colored comments:

     ;; Like the old "alt-syntax" but with faint red comments
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((builtin magenta)
             (comment red-faint)
             (constant magenta-cooler)
             (docstring magenta-faint)
             (docmarkup green-faint)
             (fnname magenta-warmer)
             (keyword cyan)
             (preprocessor cyan-cooler)
             (string red-cooler)
             (type magenta-cooler)
             (variable blue-warmer)
             (rx-construct magenta-warmer)
             (rx-backslash blue-cooler)))

   The user can always mix and match styles to their liking.

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of

Each of the following snippets give the ‘modus-themes’ a different feel
while editing code.

   Note that my ‘modus-themes’ and ‘ef-themes’ do not use the same
palettes, so some things are different.  If you copy from the latter to
the former, double-check that the entries exist in the given Modus theme
palette.

........................................................

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of
the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette overrides::).
In this code block we show how to change the background of matching
delimiters when ‘show-paren-mode’ is enabled.  We also demonstrate how
to enable underlines for those highlights.

     ;; theme-specific options, such as `modus-operandi-palette-overrides'.

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of

By default, the boxed buttons that appear in ‘M-x customize’ and related
are distinct shades of gray.  The following set of overrides removes the
gray from the active buttons and amplifies it for the inactive ones.

subdue them.

4.11.2.15 Make Org agenda more or less colorful
...............................................

This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors of
the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette overrides::).
Here we provide three distinct code blocks.  The first adds alternative
and more varied colors to the Org agenda (and related).  The second uses
faint coloration.  The third makes the agenda use various shades of
blue.  Mix and match at will, while also combining these styles with
what we show in the other chapters with practical stylistic variants.

     ;; These overrides are common to all Modus themes.  We also provide
     ;; theme-specific options, such as `modus-operandi-palette-overrides'.
     ;;
     ;; In general, the theme-specific overrides are better for overriding
     ;; color values, such as redefining what `blue-faint' looks like.  The
     ;; common overrides are best used for changes to semantic color
     ;; mappings, as we show below.

     ;; Make the Org agenda use alternative and varied colors.
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((date-common cyan)   ; default value (for timestamps and more)
             (date-deadline red-warmer)
             (date-event magenta-warmer)
             (date-holiday blue) ; for M-x calendar
             (date-now yellow-warmer)
             (date-scheduled magenta-cooler)
             (date-weekday cyan-cooler)
             (date-weekend blue-faint)))

   An example with faint coloration:

     ;; Make the Org agenda use faint colors.
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((date-common cyan-faint) ; for timestamps and more
             (date-deadline red-faint)

             (date-weekday fg-dim)
             (date-weekend fg-dim)))

   A third example that makes the agenda more blue:

     ;; Make the Org agenda use more blue instead of yellow and red.
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((date-common cyan) ; default value (for timestamps and more)

[ Part of 4.1.0-dev.  ]

   This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors
of the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette
overrides::).  In this section we show how to change diff buffers (e.g.
in ‘magit’) to only use color-coded text without any added background.
What we basically do is to disable the applicable backgrounds and then
intensify the foregrounds.  Since the deuteranopia-optimized themes do
not use the red-green color coding, we make an extra set of adjustments
for them by overriding their palettes directly instead of just using the
“common” overrides.

4.11.2.23 Make deuteranopia diffs red and blue instead of yellow and blue
.........................................................................

[ Part of 4.1.0-dev.  ]

   This is one of our practical examples to override the semantic colors
of the Modus themes (*note Stylistic variants using palette
overrides::).  In this section we show how to implement a red+blue color
coding for diffs in the themes ‘modus-operandi-deuteranopia’ and
‘modus-vivendi-deuteranopia’.  As those themes are optimized for users
with red-green color deficiency, they do not use the typical red+green
color coding for diffs, defaulting instead to yellow+blue which are
discernible.  Users with deuteranomaly or, generally, those who like a
different aesthetic, can use the following to make diffs use the
red+yellow+blue color coding for removed, changed, and added lines
respectively.  This is achieved by overriding the “changed” and
“removed” entries to use the colors of regular ‘modus-operandi’ and
‘modus-vivendi’.

     (setq modus-operandi-deuteranopia-palette-overrides
           '((bg-changed         "#ffdfa9")

things with precision (*note Customization Options: Customization

5.1 More accurate colors in terminal emulators
==============================================

[ This is based on partial information.  Please help verify and/or
expand these findings.  ]

   The graphical version of Emacs can reproduce color values accurately.
Whereas things get more tricky when Emacs is used in a terminal
emulator, because the terminals’ own capabilities determine the number
of colors that may be displayed: the Modus themes don’t look as good in
that case.

   There is, however, a way to instruct supported terminal emulators to
use more accurate colors.  In a shell prompt type ‘toe -a | grep direct’
to get a list of relevant terminfo entries.  There should be items such
as ‘xterm-direct’, ‘alacritty-direct’, ‘kitty-direct’.  Once you find
the one that corresponds to your terminal, call Emacs with an
environment variable like ‘TERM=xterm-direct’.  Example that can be
adapted to shell aliases:

     TERM=xterm-direct emacsclient -nw

   Another example that can be bound to a key:

     TERM=xterm-direct uxterm -e emacsclient -nw

5.2 Range of color with terminal emulators
==========================================

[ This is based on partial information.  Please help verify and/or
expand these findings.  ]

   When Emacs runs in a non-windowed session its color reproduction
capacity is framed or determined by the underlying terminal emulator
(*note More accurate colors in terminal emulators::).  Emacs cannot
produce a color that lies outside the range of what the terminal’s color
palette renders possible.

   This is immediately noticeable when the terminal’s first 16 codes do
not include a pure black value for the ‘termcol0’ entry and a pure white
for ‘termcol15’.  Emacs cannot set the correct background (white for
‘modus-operandi’; black for ‘modus-vivendi’) or foreground (inverse of
the background).  It thus falls back to the closest approximation, which
seldom is appropriate for the purposes of the Modus themes.

   In such a case, the user is expected to update their terminal’s color
palette such as by adapting these resources (*note Preview theme
colors::):

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Preview theme colors,  Next: Per-theme customization settings,  Prev: Range of color with terminal emulators,  Up: Advanced customization

5.3 Preview theme colors
========================

The command ‘modus-themes-list-colors’ uses minibuffer completion to
select an item from the Modus themes and then produces a buffer with
previews of its color palette entries.  The buffer has a naming scheme
that reflects the given choice, like ‘modus-operandi-list-colors’ for
the ‘modus-operandi’ theme.

   The command ‘modus-themes-list-colors-current’ skips the minibuffer
selection process and just produces a preview for the current Modus
theme.

   When called with a prefix argument (‘C-u’ with the default key
bindings), these commands will show a preview of the palette’s semantic
color mappings instead of the named colors.  In this context, “named
colors” are entries that associate a symbol to a string color value,
such as ‘(blue-warmer "#354fcf")’.  Whereas “semantic color mappings”
associate a named color to a symbol, like ‘(string blue-warmer)’, thus
making the theme render all string constructs in the ‘blue-warmer’ color
value (*note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.).

   Aliases for those commands are ‘modus-themes-preview-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-preview-colors-current’.

   Each row shows a foreground and background coloration using the
underlying value it references.  For example a line with ‘#a60000’ (a
shade of red) will show red text followed by a stripe with that same
color as a backdrop.

   The name of the buffer describes the given Modus theme and what the
contents are, such as ‘*modus-operandi-list-colors*’ for named colors
and ‘=*modus-operandi-list-mappings*’ for the semantic color mappings.

5.4 Per-theme customization settings
====================================

If you prefer to maintain different customization options between the
two themes, it is best you write your own functions that first set those
options and then load the relevant theme.  The following code does
exactly that by simply differentiating the two themes on the choice of
bold constructs in code syntax (enabled for one, disabled for the
other).

     (defun my-demo-modus-operandi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs t) ; ENABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-theme 'modus-operandi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-vivendi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs nil) ; DISABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-theme 'modus-vivendi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-themes-toggle ()
       (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-operandi)
           (my-demo-modus-vivendi)
         (my-demo-modus-operandi)))

   Then assign ‘my-demo-modus-themes-toggle’ to a key instead of the
equivalent the themes provide.

   For a more elaborate design, it is better to inspect the source code
of ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and relevant functions.

5.5 Get a single color from the palette
=======================================

[ Part of 4.1.0-dev.  ]

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

   The fuction ‘modus-themes-get-color-value’ can be called from Lisp to
return the value of a color from the active Modus theme palette.  It
takea a ‘COLOR’ argument and an optional ‘OVERRIDES’.

   ‘COLOR’ is a symbol that represents a named color entry in the
palette.

   *note Preview theme colors::.

   If the value is the name of another color entry in the palette (so a
mapping), this function recurs until it finds the underlying color
value.

   With an optional ‘OVERRIDES’ argument as a non-nil value, it accounts
for palette overrides.  Else it reads only the default palette.

   *note Option for palette overrides: Palette overrides.

   With optional ‘THEME’ as a symbol among ‘modus-themes-items’, use the
palette of that item.  Else use the current Modus theme.

   If ‘COLOR’ is not present in the palette, this function returns the
‘unspecified’ symbol, which is safe when used as a face attribute’s
value.

   An example with ‘modus-operandi’ to show how this function behaves
with/without overrides and when recursive mappings are introduced.

     ;; Here we show the recursion of palette mappings.  In general, it is
     ;; better for the user to specify named colors to avoid possible
     ;; confusion with their configuration, though those still work as
     ;; expected.
     (setq modus-themes-common-palette-overrides
           '((cursor red)
             (fg-mode-line-active cursor)
             (border-mode-line-active fg-mode-line-active)))

     ;; Ignore the overrides and get the original value.
     (modus-themes-get-color-value 'border-mode-line-active)
     ;; => "#5a5a5a"

     ;; Read from the overrides and deal with any recursion to find the
     ;; underlying value.
     (modus-themes-get-color-value 'border-mode-line-active :overrides)
     ;; => "#a60000"

5.6 Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors
==========================================================

*note Get a single color from the palette::.

   Note that users most probably do not need the following.  Just rely
on the comprehensive overrides we provide (*note Option for palette
overrides: Palette overrides.).

   Advanced users may want to apply colors from the palette of the
active Modus theme in their custom code.  The ‘modus-themes-with-colors’
macro supplies those to any form called inside of it.  For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (list blue-warmer magenta-cooler fg-added warning variable fg-heading-4))
     ;; => ("#354fcf" "#531ab6" "#005000" "#884900" "#005e8b" "#721045")

   The above return value is for ‘modus-operandi’ when that is the
active theme.  Switching to another theme and evaluating this code anew
will give us the relevant results for that theme (remember that since
version 4, the Modus themes consist of six items (*note Overview::)).
The same with ‘modus-vivendi’ as the active theme:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (list blue-warmer magenta-cooler fg-added warning variable fg-heading-4))
     ;; => ("#79a8ff" "#b6a0ff" "#a0e0a0" "#fec43f" "#00d3d0" "#feacd0")

   The ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ has access to the whole palette of the
active theme, meaning that it can instantiate both (i) named colors like
‘blue-warmer’ and (ii) semantic color mappings like ‘warning’.  We
provide commands to inspect those (*note Preview theme colors::).

   Others sections in this manual show how to use the aforementioned
macro (*note Advanced customization::).

   Because the ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ will most likely be used to
customize faces, note that any function that calls it must be run at
startup after the theme loads.  The same function must also be assigned
to the ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’ for its effects to persist
and be updated when switching between Modus themes (e.g.  to update the
exact value of ‘blue-warmer’ when toggling between ‘modus-operandi’ to
‘modus-vivendi’.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Do not extend the region background,  Next: Add padding to mode line,  Prev: Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors,  Up: Advanced customization

5.7 Do not extend the region background
=======================================

By the default, the background of the ‘region’ face extends from the end
of the line to the edge of the window.  To limit it to the end of the
line, we need to override the face’s ‘:extend’ attribute.  Adding this
to the Emacs configuration file will suffice:

     ;; Do not extend `region' background past the end of the line.
     (custom-set-faces
      '(region ((t :extend nil))))

   *note Make the region preserve text colors, plus other styles: Make
the region preserve text colors plus other styles.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Add padding to mode line,  Next: Remap face with local value,  Prev: Do not extend the region background,  Up: Advanced customization

5.8 Add padding to mode line
============================

Emacs faces do not have a concept of “padding” for the space between the
text and its box boundaries.  We can approximate the effect by adding a
‘:box’ attribute, making its border several pixels thick, and using the
mode line’s background color for it.  This way the thick border will not
stand out and will appear as a continuation of the mode line.

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Add "padding" to the mode lines
          `(mode-line ((,c :box (:line-width 10 :color ,bg-mode-line-active))))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,c :box (:line-width 10 :color ,bg-mode-line-inactive)))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   The above has the effect of removing the border around the mode
lines.  In older versions of the themes, we provided the option for a
padded mode line which could also have borders around it.  Those were
not real border, however, but an underline and an overline.  Adjusting
the above:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Add "padding" to the mode lines
          `(mode-line ((,c :underline ,border-mode-line-active
                           :overline ,border-mode-line-active
                           :box (:line-width 10 :color ,bg-mode-line-active))))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,c :underline ,border-mode-line-inactive
                                    :overline ,border-mode-line-inactive
                                    :box (:line-width 10 :color ,bg-mode-line-inactive)))))))

     ;; ESSENTIAL to make the underline move to the bottom of the box:
     (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   The reason we no longer provide this option is because it depends on
a non-nil value for ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’.  That variable
affects ALL underlines, including those of links.  The effect is
intrusive and looks awkard in prose.

   As such, the Modus themes no longer provide that option but instead
offer this piece of documentation to make the user fully aware of the
state of affairs.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Remap face with local value,  Next: Font configurations for Org and others,  Prev: Add padding to mode line,  Up: Advanced customization

5.9 Remap face with local value
===============================

There are cases where we need to change the buffer-local attributes of a
face.  This might be because we have our own minor mode that re-uses a
face for a particular purpose, such as a line selection tool that
activates ‘hl-line-mode’, but we wish to keep it distinct from other
buffers.  This is where ‘face-remap-add-relative’ can be applied and may
be combined with ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ to deliver consistent
results.

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

   In this example we will write a simple interactive function that
adjusts the background color of the ‘region’ face.  This is the sample
code:

     (defvar my-rainbow-region-colors
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         `((red . ,bg-red-subtle)
           (green . ,bg-green-subtle)
           (yellow . ,bg-yellow-subtle)
           (blue . ,bg-blue-subtle)
           (magenta . ,bg-magenta-subtle)
           (cyan . ,bg-cyan-subtle)))
       "Sample list of color values for `my-rainbow-region'.")

     (defun my-rainbow-region (color)
       "Remap buffer-local attribute of `region' using COLOR."
       (interactive
        (list
         (completing-read "Pick a color: " my-rainbow-region-colors)))
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'region
        `( :background ,(alist-get (intern color) my-rainbow-region-colors)
           :foreground ,(face-attribute 'default :foreground))))

   When ‘my-rainbow-region’ is called interactively, it prompts for a
color to use.  The list of candidates is drawn from the car of each
association in ‘my-rainbow-region-colors’ (so “red”, “green”, etc.).

   To extend this principle, we may write wrapper functions that pass a
color directly.  Those can be useful in tandem with hooks.  Consider
this example:

     (defun my-rainbow-region-magenta ()
       (my-rainbow-region 'magenta))

     (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook #'my-rainbow-region-magenta)

   Whenever we enter a ‘diff-mode’ buffer, we now get a magenta-colored
region.

   Perhaps you may wish to generalize those findings in to a set of
functions that also accept an arbitrary face.  We shall leave the
experimentation up to you.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Font configurations for Org and others,  Next: Configure bold and italic faces,  Prev: Remap face with local value,  Up: Advanced customization

5.10 Font configurations for Org and others
===========================================

The themes are designed to optionally cope well with mixed font
configurations.  This mostly concerns ‘org-mode’ and ‘markdown-mode’,
though expect to find it elsewhere like in ‘Info-mode’.

   *note Option for font mixing: Mixed fonts.

   In practice it means that the user can safely opt for a more
prose-friendly proportionately spaced typeface as their default, while
spacing-sensitive elements like tables and inline code always use a
monospaced font, by inheriting from the ‘fixed-pitch’ face.

   Users can try the built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’ to see the
effect in action.

   To make everything use your desired font families, you need to
configure the ‘variable-pitch’ (proportional spacing) and ‘fixed-pitch’
(monospaced) faces respectively.  It may also be convenient to set your
main typeface by configuring the ‘default’ face the same way.

   [ The ‘fontaine’ package on GNU ELPA (by Protesilaos) is designed to
handle this case.  ]

   Put something like this in your initialization file (also consider
reading the doc string of ‘set-face-attribute’):

     ;; Main typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 110)

     ;; Proportionately spaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Serif" :height 1.0)

     ;; Monospaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 1.5)

   Or employ the ‘face-attribute’ function to read an existing value,
such as if you want to make ‘fixed-pitch’ use the font family of the
‘default’ face:

     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family (face-attribute 'default :family))

   The next section shows how to make those work in a more elaborate
setup that is robust to changes between the Modus themes.

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.

   Note the differences in the ‘:height’ property.  The ‘default’ face
must specify an absolute value, which is the point size × 10.  So if you
want to use a font at point size ‘11’, you set the height to ‘110’.(1)
Whereas every other face must either not specify a height or have a
value that is relative to the default, represented as a floating point.
If you use an integer, then that means an absolute height.  This is of
paramount importance: it ensures that all fonts can scale gracefully
when using something like the ‘text-scale-adjust’ command which only
operates on the base font size (i.e.  the ‘default’ face’s absolute
height).

   *note Note for EWW and Elfeed fonts: Note on SHR fonts.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) ‘:height’ values do not need to be rounded to multiples of ten:
the likes of ‘115’ are perfectly valid—some typefaces will change to
account for those finer increments.

5.11 Configure bold and italic faces
====================================

The Modus themes do not hardcode a ‘:weight’ or ‘:slant’ attribute in
the thousands of faces they cover.  Instead, they configure the generic
faces called ‘bold’ and ‘italic’ to use the appropriate styles and then
instruct all relevant faces that require emphasis to inherit from them.

   This practically means that users can change the particularities of
what it means for a construct to be bold/italic, by tweaking the ‘bold’
and ‘italic’ faces.  Cases where that can be useful include:

   • The default typeface does not have a variant with slanted glyphs
     (e.g.  Fira Mono/Code as of this writing on 2021-07-07), so the
     user wants to add another family for the italics, such as Hack.

   • The typeface of choice provides a multitude of weights and the user
     prefers the light one by default.  To prevent the bold weight from
     being too heavy compared to the light one, they opt to make ‘bold’
     use a semibold weight.

   • The typeface distinguishes between oblique and italic forms by
     providing different font variants (the former are just slanted
     versions of the upright forms, while the latter have distinguishing
     features as well).  In this case, the user wants to specify the
     font that applies to the ‘italic’ face.

   To achieve those effects, one must first be sure that the fonts they
use have support for those features.  It then is a matter of following
the instructions for all typeface tweaks.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others::.

   In this example, we set the default font family to Fira Code, while
we choose to render italics in the Hack typeface (obviously you need to
pick fonts that work well together):

     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Fira Code" :height 110)
     (set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family "Hack")

   And here we play with different weights, using Source Code Pro:

     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110 :weight 'light)
     (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold)

   To reset the font family, one can use this:

     (set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family 'unspecified)

   To ensure that the effects persist after switching between the Modus
themes (such as with ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’), the user needs to write
their configurations to a function and pass it to the
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’.  This is necessary because themes
set the styles of faces upon activation, overriding prior values where
conflicts occur between the previous and the current states (otherwise
changing themes would not be possible).

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading::.

   This is a minimal setup to preserve font configurations across theme
load phases.  For a more permanent setup, it is better to rely on the
‘custom-set-faces’ function: ‘set-face-attribute’ works just fine,
though it probably is better suited for quick previews or for smaller
scale operations (‘custom-set-faces’ follows the format used in the
source code of the themes, which can make it easier to redefine faces in
bulk).

     ;; our generic function
     (defun my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces ()
       (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110)
       (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold))

     ;; or use this if you configure a lot of face and attributes and
     ;; especially if you plan to use `modus-themes-with-colors', as shown
     ;; elsewhere in the manual
     (defun my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces ()
       (custom-set-faces
        '(default ((t :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110)))
        '(bold ((t :weight semibold)))))

     ;; and here is the hook
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modes-themes-bold-italic-faces)

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Custom Org todo keyword and priority faces,  Next: Custom Org emphasis faces,  Prev: Configure bold and italic faces,  Up: Advanced customization

5.12 Custom Org todo keyword and priority faces
===============================================

Users of ‘org-mode’ have the option to configure various keywords and
priority cookies to better match their workflow.  User options are
‘org-todo-keyword-faces’ and ‘org-priority-faces’.

   As those are meant to be custom faces, it is futile to have the
themes guess what each user wants to use, which keywords to target, and
so on.  Instead, we can provide guidelines on how to customize things to
one’s liking with the intent of retaining the overall aesthetic of the
themes.

   Please bear in mind that the end result of those is not controlled by
the active Modus theme but by how Org maps faces to its constructs.
Editing those while ‘org-mode’ is active requires re-initialization of
the mode with ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.

   Let us assume you wish to visually differentiate your keywords.  You
have something like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(D)" "CANCEL(C)")
             (sequence "MEET(m)" "|" "MET(M)")
             (sequence "STUDY(s)" "|" "STUDIED(S)")
             (sequence "WRITE(w)" "|" "WROTE(W)")))

   You could then use a variant of the following to inherit from a face
that uses the styles you want and also to preserve the properties
applied by the ‘org-todo’ face (in case there is a difference between
the two):

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . '(bold org-todo))
             ("STUDY" . '(warning org-todo))
             ("WRITE" . '(shadow org-todo))))

   This will refashion the keywords you specify, while letting the other
items in ‘org-todo-keywords’ use their original styles (which are
defined in the ‘org-todo’ and ‘org-done’ faces).

   If you want back the defaults, try specifying just the ‘org-todo’
face:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . org-todo)
             ("STUDY" . org-todo)
             ("WRITE" . org-todo)))

   When you inherit from multiple faces, you need to quote the list as
shown further above.  The order is significant: the first entry is
applied on top of the second, overriding any properties that are
explicitly set for both of them: any property that is not specified is
not overridden, so, for example, if ‘org-todo’ has a background and a
foreground, while ‘font-lock-type-face’ only has a foreground, the
merged face will include the background of the former and the foreground
of the latter.  If you do not want to blend multiple faces, you do not
need a quoted list.  A pattern of ‘keyword . face’ will suffice.

   Both approaches can be used simultaneously, as illustrated in this
configuration of the priority cookies:

     (setq org-priority-faces
           '((?A . '(bold org-priority))
             (?B . org-priority)
             (?C . '(shadow org-priority))))

   To find all the faces that are loaded in your current Emacs session,
use ‘M-x list-faces-display’.  Try ‘M-x describe-variable’ as well and
then specify the name of each of those Org variables demonstrated above.
Their documentation strings will offer you further guidance.

   Recall that the themes let you retrieve a color from their palette.
Do it if you plan to control face attributes.

   *note Check color combinations: Measure color contrast.

5.13 Custom Org emphasis faces
==============================

Org provides the user option ‘org-emphasis-alist’ which associates a
character with a face, list of faces, or face attributes.  The default
specification of that variable looks like this:

     (setq org-emphasis-alist
           '(("*" bold)
             ("/" italic)
             ("_" underline)
             ("=" org-verbatim verbatim)
             ("~" org-code verbatim)
             ("+" (:strike-through t))))

   With the exception of ‘org-verbatim’ and ‘org-code’ faces, everything
else uses the corresponding type of emphasis: a bold typographic weight,
or italicised, underlined, and struck through text.

   The best way for users to add some extra attributes, such as a
foreground color, is to define their own faces and assign them to the
given emphasis marker/character.

   This is a custom face that extends the standard ‘bold’ face with a
red foreground value (so it colorises the text in addition to the bold
weight):

     (defface my-org-emphasis-bold
       '((default :inherit bold)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#a60000")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#ff8059"))
       "My bold emphasis for Org.")

   This face definition reads as follows:

   • Always inherit the ‘bold’ face (*note Configure bold and italic
     faces::).
   • For versions of Emacs that support at least 88 colors (graphical
     Emacs, for example) and use a light background, apply the ‘#a60000’
     value.
   • For the same kind of Emacs that has a dark background use the
     ‘#ff8059’ color instead.

   Same principle for how to extend ‘italic’ and ‘underline’ with, for
example, green and yellow hues, respectively:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-italic
       '((default :inherit italic)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#005e00")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#44bc44"))
       "My italic emphasis for Org.")

     (defface my-org-emphasis-underline
       '((default :inherit underline)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#813e00")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#d0bc00"))
       "My underline emphasis for Org.")

   In the case of a strike-through effect, we have no generic face to
inherit from, so we can write it as follows to also change the
foreground to a more subtle gray:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((default :strike-through t)
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :foreground "#505050")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :foreground "#a8a8a8"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   Or we can just change the color of the line that strikes through the
text to, for example, a shade of red:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :strike-through "#972500")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :strike-through "#ef8b50"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   It is possible to combine those effects:

     (defface my-org-emphasis-strike-through
       '((((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
          :strike-through "#972500" :foreground "#505050")
         (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
          :strike-through "#ef8b50" :foreground "#a8a8a8"))
       "My strike-through emphasis for Org.")

   One may inspect the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ for possible color values.  Or call the
command ‘modus-themes-list-colors’ to show a buffer that previews each
entry in the palette.

   *note Visualize the active Modus theme’s palette: Preview theme
colors.

   Once we have defined the faces we need, we must update the
‘org-emphasis-alist’.  Given that ‘org-verbatim’ and ‘org-code’ are
already styled by the themes, it probably is best not to edit them:

     (setq org-emphasis-alist
           '(("*" my-org-emphasis-bold)
             ("/" my-org-emphasis-italic)
             ("_" my-org-emphasis-underline)
             ("=" org-verbatim verbatim)
             ("~" org-code verbatim)
             ("+" my-org-emphasis-strike-through)))

   That’s it!  For changes to take effect in already visited Org files,
invoke ‘M-x org-mode-restart’.

5.14 Update Org block delimiter fontification
=============================================

As noted in the section about ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’, Org contains a
variable that determines whether the block’s begin and end lines are
extended to the edge of the window (*note Option for org-mode block
styles: Org mode blocks.).  The variable is
‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’.

   Users who change the style of Org blocks from time to time may prefer
to automatically update delimiter line fontification, such as with the
following setup:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil)))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook
               #'my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines)

   Then ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect, though manual
intervention can be circumvented by tweaking the function thus:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil))
       (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
         (font-lock-flush)))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Measure color contrast,  Next: Load theme depending on time of day,  Prev: Update Org block delimiter fontification,  Up: Advanced customization

5.15 Measure color contrast
===========================

The themes provide the functions ‘modus-themes-wcag-formula’ and
‘modus-themes-contrast’.  The former is a direct implementation of the
WCAG formula: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html>.  It
calculates the relative luminance of a color value that is expressed in
hexadecimal RGB notation.  While the latter function is just a
convenient wrapper for comparing the relative luminance between two
colors.

   In practice, one needs to work only with ‘modus-themes-contrast’.  It
accepts two color values and returns their contrast ratio.  Values range
from 1 to 21 (lowest to highest).  The themes are designed to always be
equal or higher than 7 for each combination of background and foreground
that they use (this is the WCAG AAA standard—the most demanding of its
kind).

   A couple of examples (rounded numbers):

     ;; Pure white with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#ffffff" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 1.37
     ;; That is an outright inaccessible combo

     ;; Pure black with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 15.3
     ;; That is a highly accessible combo

   It does not matter which color value comes first.  The ratio is
always the same.

   If one does not wish to read all the decimal points, it is possible
to try something like this:

     (format "%0.2f" (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00"))

   While it is fine to perform such calculations on a case-by-case
basis, it is preferable to implement formulas and tables for more
demanding tasks.  Such instruments are provided by ‘org-mode’ or
‘orgtbl-mode’, both of which are built into Emacs.  Below is such a
table that derives the contrast ratio of all colors in the first column
(pure red, green, blue) relative to the color specified in the first row
of the second column (pure white) and rounds the results:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |
     | #00ff00 |    1.37 |
     | #0000ff |    8.59 |
     #+tblfm: $2='(modus-themes-contrast $1 @1$2);%0.2f

   To measure color contrast one needs to start from a known value.
This typically is the background.  The Modus themes define an expanded
palette in large part because certain colors are only meant to be used
in combination with some others.  Consult the source code for the
minutia and relevant commentary.

   Such knowledge may prove valuable while attempting to customize the
theme’s color palette.

5.16 Load theme depending on time of day
========================================

While we do provide ‘modus-themes-toggle’ to manually switch between the
themes, users may also set up their system to perform such a task
automatically at sunrise and sunset.

   This can be accomplished by specifying the coordinates of one’s
location using the built-in ‘solar.el’ and then configuring the
‘circadian’ package:

     (use-package solar                      ; built-in
       :config
       (setq calendar-latitude 35.17
             calendar-longitude 33.36))

     (use-package circadian                  ; you need to install this
       :ensure t
       :after solar
       :config
       (setq circadian-themes '((:sunrise . modus-operandi)
                                (:sunset  . modus-vivendi)))
       (circadian-setup))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Backdrop for pdf-tools,  Next: Toggle themes without reloading them,  Prev: Load theme depending on time of day,  Up: Advanced customization

5.17 Backdrop for pdf-tools
===========================

Most PDF files use a white background for their page, making it
impossible to discern the file’s boundaries in the buffer while using
the Modus Operandi theme.  To introduce a distinction between the
buffer’s backdrop and the PDF page’s background, the former must be
rendered as some shade of gray.  Ideally, ‘pdf-tools’ would provide a
face that the themes could support directly, though this does not seem
to be the case for the time being.  We must thus employ the face
remapping technique that is documented elsewhere in this document to
change the buffer-local value of the ‘default’ face.

   *note Remap face with local value::.

   To remap the buffer’s backdrop, we start with a function like this
one:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (face-remap-add-relative
          'default
          `(:background ,bg-dim))))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-backdrop)

   The idea is to assign that function to a hook that gets called when
‘pdf-tools’ renders the document: ‘pdf-tools-enabled-hook’.  This is
enough when you only use one theme.  However it has the downside of
setting the background color value only at render time.  In other words,
the face remapping function does not get evaluated anew whenever the
theme changes, such as upon invoking ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’.

   To have our face remapping adapt gracefully while switching between
the Modus themes, we need to also account for the current theme and
control the activation of ‘pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode’.  To which end
we arrive at something like the following, which builds on the above
example:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (face-remap-add-relative
          'default
          `(:background ,bg-dim))))

     (defun my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle ()
       (when (derived-mode-p 'pdf-view-mode)
         (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-vivendi)
             (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode 1)
           (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode -1))
         (my-pdf-tools-backdrop)))

     (defun my-pdf-tools-themes-toggle ()
       (mapc
        (lambda (buf)
          (with-current-buffer buf
            (my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)))
        (buffer-list)))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-pdf-tools-themes-toggle)

   With those in place, PDFs have a distinct backdrop for their page,
while buffers with major-mode as ‘pdf-view-mode’ automatically switches
to dark mode when ‘modus-themes-toggle’ is called.

5.18 Toggle themes without reloading them
=========================================

Users who have a stable setup and who only ever need to toggle between
the themes without triggering a full reload, are better off defining
their own command which calls ‘enable-theme’ instead of ‘load-theme’:

     (defun my-modus-themes-toggle ()
       "Toggle between `modus-operandi' and `modus-vivendi' themes.
     This uses `enable-theme' instead of the standard method of
     `load-theme'.  The technicalities are covered in the Modus themes
     manual."
       (interactive)
       (pcase (modus-themes--current-theme)
         ('modus-operandi (progn (enable-theme 'modus-vivendi)
                                 (disable-theme 'modus-operandi)))
         ('modus-vivendi (progn (enable-theme 'modus-operandi)
                                 (disable-theme 'modus-vivendi)))
         (_ (error "No Modus theme is loaded; evaluate `modus-themes-load-themes' first"))))

   *note Differences between loading and enabling::.

   Recall that ‘modus-themes-toggle’ uses ‘load-theme’.

5.19 A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading
============================================

The themes are designed with the intent to be useful to Emacs users of
varying skill levels, from beginners to experts.  This means that we try
to make things easier by not expecting anyone reading this document to
be proficient in Emacs Lisp or programming in general.

   Such a case is with the use of ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’,
which runs after the ‘modus-themes-load-theme’ function (used by the
command ‘modus-themes-toggle’).  We recommend using that hook for
advanced customizations, because (1) we know for sure that it is
available once the themes are loaded, and (2) anyone consulting this
manual, especially the sections on enabling and loading the themes, will
be in a good position to benefit from that hook.

   Advanced users who have a need to switch between the Modus themes and
other items will find that such a hook does not meet their requirements:
it only works with the Modus themes and only with the aforementioned
functions.

   A theme-agnostic setup can be configured thus:

     (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil
        "Normal hook run after enabling a theme.")

     (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args)
        "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'."
        (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook))

     (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook)

   This creates the ‘after-enable-theme-hook’ and makes it run after
each call to ‘enable-theme’, which means that it will work for all
themes and also has the benefit that it does not depend on functions
such as ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and the others mentioned above.
‘enable-theme’ is called internally by ‘load-theme’, so the hook works
everywhere.

   The downside of the theme-agnostic hook is that any functions added
to it will likely not be able to benefit from macro calls that read the
active theme, such as ‘modus-themes-with-colors’.  Not all Emacs themes
have the same capabilities.

   In this document, we cover ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’
though the user can replace it with ‘after-enable-theme-hook’ should
they need to (provided they understand the implications).

5.20 Custom hl-todo colors
==========================

The ‘hl-todo’ package provides the user option ‘hl-todo-keyword-faces’:
it specifies a pair of keyword and corresponding color value.  The Modus
themes configure that option in the interest of legibility.  While this
works for our purposes, users may still prefer to apply their custom
values, in which case the following approach is necessary:

     (defun my-modus-themes-hl-todo-faces ()
       (setq hl-todo-keyword-faces '(("TODO" . "#ff0000")
                                     ("HACK" . "#ffff00")
                                     ("XXX" . "#00ffff")
                                     ("NOTE" . "#ff00ff"))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-hl-todo-faces)

   Or include a ‘let’ form, if needed:

     (defun my-modus-themes-hl-todo-faces ()
       (let ((red "#ff0000")
             (blue "#0000ff"))
         (setq hl-todo-keyword-faces `(("TODO" . ,blue)
                                       ("HACK" . ,red)
                                       ("XXX" . ,red)
                                       ("NOTE" . ,blue)))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-hl-todo-faces)

   Normally, we do not touch user options, though this is an exception:
otherwise the defaults are not always legible.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Add support for solaire-mode,  Prev: Custom hl-todo colors,  Up: Advanced customization

5.21 Add support for solaire-mode
=================================

The ‘solaire-mode’ package dims the background of what it considers
ancillary “UI” buffers, such as the minibuffer and Dired buffers.  The
Modus themes used to support Solaire on the premise that the user was
(i) opting in to it, (ii) understood why certain buffers were more gray,
and (iii) knew what other adjustments had to be made to prevent broken
visuals (e.g.  the default style of the ‘modus-themes-completions’ uses
a subtle gray background for the selection, which with Solaire becomes
practically invisible).

   However, the assumption that users opt in to this feature does not
always hold true.  There are cases where it is enabled by defaultsuch as
in the popular Doom Emacs configuration.  Thus, the unsuspecting user
who loads ‘modus-operandi’ or ‘modus-vivendi’ without the requisite
customizations is getting a sub-par experience; an experience that we
did not intend and cannot genuinely fix.

   Because the Modus themes are meant to work everywhere, we cannot make
an exception for Doom Emacs and/or Solaire users.  Furthermore, we shall
not introduce hacks, such as by adding a check in all relevant faces to
be adjusted based on Solaire or whatever other package.  Hacks of this
sort are unsustainable and penalize the entire userbase.  Besides, the
themes are built into Emacs and we must keep their standard high.

   The fundamental constraint with Solaire is that Emacs does not have a
real distinction between “content” and “UI” buffers.  For themes to work
with Solaire, they need to be designed around that package.  Such is an
arrangement that compromises on our accessibility standards and/or
hinders our efforts to provide the best possible experience while using
the Modus themes.

   As such, ‘solaire-mode’ is not—and will not be—supported by the Modus
themes (or any other of my themes, for that matter).  Users who want it
must style the faces manually.  Below is some sample code, based on what
we cover at length elsewhere in this manual:

   *note Advanced customization::.

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(solaire-default-face ((,c :inherit default :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,fg-dim)))
          `(solaire-line-number-face ((,c :inherit solaire-default-face :foreground ,fg-unfocused)))
          `(solaire-hl-line-face ((,c :background ,bg-active)))
          `(solaire-org-hide-face ((,c :background ,bg-dim :foreground ,bg-dim))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

7.1 Note on calendar.el weekday and weekend colors
==================================================

By default, the ‘M-x calendar’ interface differentiates weekdays from
weekends by applying a gray color to the former and a faint red to the
latter.  The idea for this approach is that the weekend should serve as
a subtle warning that no work is supposed to be done on that day, per
the design of traditional calendars.

   Users who prefer all days to look the same can configure the variable
‘calendar-weekend-days’ to either use gray of weekdays or the faint red
of weekends uniformly.

     ;; All are treated like weekdays (gray color)
     (setq calendar-weekend-days nil)

     ;; All are treated like weekends (red-faint color)
     (setq calendar-weekend-days (number-sequence 0 6))

     ;; The default marks the Saturday and Sunday as the weekend
     (setq calendar-weekend-days '(0 6))

   For changes to take effect, the Calendar buffer needs to be generated
anew.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on git-gutter in Doom Emacs,  Next: Note on php-mode multiline comments,  Prev: Note on calendarel weekday and weekend colors,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.2 Note on git-gutter in Doom Emacs
====================================

The ‘git-gutter’ and ‘git-gutter-fr’ packages default to drawing bitmaps
for the indicators they display (e.g.  bitmap of a plus sign for added
lines).  In Doom Emacs, these bitmaps are replaced with contiguous lines
which may look nicer, but require a change to the foreground of the
relevant faces to yield the desired color combinations.

   Since this is Doom-specific, we urge users to apply changes in their
local setup.  Below is some sample code, based on what we cover at
length elsewhere in this manual:

   *note Advanced customization::.

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Make foreground the same as background for a uniform bar on
          ;; Doom Emacs.
          ;;
          ;; Doom should not be implementing such hacks because themes
          ;; cannot support them:
          ;; <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-04-doom-git-gutter-modus-themes/>.
          `(git-gutter-fr:added ((,c :foreground ,bg-added-intense)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((,c :foreground ,bg-removed-intense)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((,c :foreground ,bg-changed-intense))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

   If the above does not work, try this instead:

     (after! modus-themes
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          ;; Make foreground the same as background for a uniform bar on
          ;; Doom Emacs.
          ;;
          ;; Doom should not be implementing such hacks because themes
          ;; cannot support them:
          ;; <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-04-doom-git-gutter-modus-themes/>.
          `(git-gutter-fr:added ((,c :foreground ,bg-added-intense)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((,c :foreground ,bg-removed-intense)))
          `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((,c :foreground ,bg-changed-intense))))))


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on php-mode multiline comments,  Next: Note on underlines in compilation buffers,  Prev: Note on git-gutter in Doom Emacs,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.3 Note on php-mode multiline comments
=======================================

Depending on your build of Emacs and/or the environment it runs in,
multiline comments in PHP with the ‘php-mode’ package use the
‘font-lock-doc-face’ instead of ‘font-lock-comment-face’.

   This seems to make all comments use the appropriate face:

     (defun my-multine-comments ()
       (setq-local c-doc-face-name 'font-lock-comment-face))

     (add-hook 'php-mode-hook #'my-multine-comments)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

7.4 Note on underlines in compilation buffers
=============================================

Various buffers that produce compilation results or run tests on code
apply an underline to the file names they reference or to relevant
messages.  Users may consider this unnecessary or excessive.

   To outright disable the effect, use this (buffers need to be
generated anew):

     (setq compilation-message-face nil)

   If some element of differentiation is still desired, a good option is
to render the affected text with the ‘italic’ face:

     (setq compilation-message-face 'italic)

   *note Configure bold and italic faces::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on inline Latex in Org buffers,  Next: Note on dimmerel,  Prev: Note on underlines in compilation buffers,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.5 Note on inline Latex in Org buffers
=======================================

Org can work with inline latex and related syntax.  To actually fontify
those constructs, set the variable ‘org-highlight-latex-and-related’ to
the desired list of values (per its doc string).  For example:

     (setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex script))

   Remember to use ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on dimmerel,  Next: Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode,  Prev: Note on inline Latex in Org buffers,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.6 Note on dimmer.el
=====================

The ‘dimmer.el’ library by Neil Okamoto can be configured to
automatically dim the colors of inactive Emacs windows.  To guarantee
consistent results with the Modus themes, we suggest some tweaks to the
default styles, such as in this minimal setup:

     (use-package dimmer
       :config
       (setq dimmer-fraction 0.3)
       (setq dimmer-adjustment-mode :foreground)
       (setq dimmer-use-colorspace :rgb)

       (dimmer-mode 1))

   Of the above, we strongly recommend the RGB color space because it is
the one that remains faithful to the hueness of the colors used by the
themes.  Whereas the default CIELAB space has a tendency to distort
colors in addition to applying the dim effect, which can be somewhat
disorienting.

   The value of the ‘dimmer-fraction’ has been selected empirically.
Users might prefer to tweak it further (increasing it makes the dim
effect more pronounced).

   Changing the ‘dimmer-adjustment-mode’ is a matter of preference.
Though because the Modus themes use black and white as their base
colors, any other value for that variable will turn the main background
gray.  This inadvertently leads to the opposite of the intended utility
of this package: it draws too much attention to unfocused windows.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode,  Next: Note on highlight-parenthesesel,  Prev: Note on dimmerel,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.7 Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode
==============================================

The ‘display-fill-column-indicator-mode’ uses a typographic character to
draw its line.  This has the downside of creating a dashed line.  The
dashes are further apart depending on how tall the font’s glyph height
is and what integer the ‘line-spacing’ is set to.

   At the theme level we eliminate this effect by making the character
one pixel tall: the line is contiguous.  Users who prefer the dashed
line are advised to change the ‘fill-column-indicator’ face, as
explained elsewhere in this document.  For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(fill-column-indicator ((,c :foreground ,bg-active)))))

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

   To make the line thicker, set the height to be equal to the base font
size instead of the one pixel we use.  This is done by specifying a rate
instead of an absolute number, as in ‘:height 1.0’ versus ‘:height 1’.
For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(fill-column-indicator ((,c :height 1.0 :background ,bg-inactive :foreground ,bg-inactive)))))

7.8 Note on highlight-parentheses.el
====================================

The ‘highlight-parentheses’ package provides contextual coloration of
surrounding parentheses, highlighting only those which are around the
point.  The package expects users to customize the applicable colors on
their own by configuring certain variables.

   To make the Modus themes work as expected with this, we need to use
some of the techniques that are discussed at length in the various
“Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) sections, which provide insight into the more
advanced customization options of the themes.

   *note Advanced customization::.

   In the following example, we are assuming that the user wants to (i)
re-use color variables provided by the themes, (ii) be able to retain
their tweaks while switching between ‘modus-operandi’ and
‘modus-vivendi’, and (iii) have the option to highlight either the
foreground of the parentheses or the background as well.

   We start by defining our own variable, which will serve as a toggle
between foreground and background coloration styles:

     (defvar my-highlight-parentheses-use-background t
       "Prefer `highlight-parentheses-background-colors'.")

   Then we can update our preference with this:

     ;; Set to nil to disable backgrounds.
     (setq my-highlight-parentheses-use-background nil)

   To re-use colors from the themes, we must wrap our code in the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro.  Our implementation must interface
with the variables ‘highlight-parentheses-background-colors’ and/or
‘highlight-parentheses-colors’.

   So we can have something like this (the doc string of
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ explains where the names of the colors can be
found):

     (modus-themes-with-colors
         ;; Our preference for setting either background or foreground
         ;; styles, depending on `my-highlight-parentheses-use-background'.
         (if my-highlight-parentheses-use-background

             ;; Here we set color combinations that involve both a background
             ;; and a foreground value.
             (setq highlight-parentheses-background-colors (list bg-cyan-intense
                                                                 bg-magenta-intense
                                                                 bg-green-intense
                                                                 bg-yellow-intense)
                   highlight-parentheses-colors (list cyan
                                                      magenta
                                                      green
                                                      yellow))

           ;; And here we pass only foreground colors while disabling any
           ;; backgrounds.
           (setq highlight-parentheses-colors (list green-intense
                                                    magenta-intense
                                                    blue-intense
                                                    red-intense)
                 highlight-parentheses-background-colors nil)))

     ;; Include this if you also want to make the parentheses bold:
     (set-face-attribute 'highlight-parentheses-highlight nil :inherit 'bold)

     ;; Our changes must be evaluated before enabling the relevant mode, so
     ;; this comes last.
     (global-highlight-parentheses-mode 1)

   For our changes to persist while switching between the Modus themes,
we need to include them in a function which can then get passed to
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’.  This is the complete
implementation:

     ;; Configurations for `highlight-parentheses':
     (require 'highlight-parentheses)

     (defvar my-highlight-parentheses-use-background t
       "Prefer `highlight-parentheses-background-colors'.")

           ;; And here we pass only foreground colors while disabling any

                                                    red-intense)
                 highlight-parentheses-background-colors nil)))

       (global-highlight-parentheses-mode 1))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-highlight-parentheses)

   As always, re-load the theme for changes to take effect.

7.9 Note on mmm-mode.el background colors
=========================================

The faces used by ‘mmm-mode.el’ are expected to have a colorful
background, while they should not touch any foreground value.  The idea
is that they must not interfere with existing fontification.  Those
background colors need to be distinct from each other, such as an
unambiguous red juxtaposed with a clear blue.

   While this design may be internally consistent with the raison d’être
of that library, it inevitably produces inaccessible color combinations.

   There are two competing goals at play:

  1. Legibility of the text, understood as the contrast ratio between
     the background and the foreground.

  2. Semantic precision of each face which entails faithfulness to
     color-coding of the underlying background.

   As the Modus themes are designed with the express purpose of
conforming with the first point, we have to forgo the apparent
color-coding of the background elements.  Instead we use subtle colors
that do not undermine the legibility of the affected text while they
still offer a sense of added context.

   Users who might prefer to fall below the minimum 7:1 contrast ratio
in relative luminance (the accessibility target we conform with), can
opt to configure the relevant faces on their own.

   *note Use theme colors in code with modus-themes-with-colors::.

   This example uses more vivid background colors, though it comes at
the very high cost of degraded legibility.

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(mmm-cleanup-submode-face ((,c :background ,bg-yellow-intense)))
        `(mmm-code-submode-face ((,c :background ,bg-inactive)))

7.10 Note on prism.el
=====================

This package by Adam Porter, aka “alphapapa” or “github-alphapapa”,
implements an alternative to the typical coloration of code.  Instead of
highlighting the syntactic constructs, it applies color to different
levels of depth in the code structure.

   As ‘prism.el’ offers a broad range of customizations, we cannot style
it directly at the theme level: that would run contrary to the spirit of
the package.  Instead, we may offer preset color schemes.  Those should
offer a starting point for users to adapt to their needs.

   In the following code snippets, we employ the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro: *note Use theme colors in code with
modus-themes-with-colors::.

   These are the minimum recommended settings with 16 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 16)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       magenta
                       cyan-cooler
                       magenta-cooler
                       blue
                       magenta-warmer
                       cyan-warmer
                       red-cooler
                       green
                       fg-main
                       cyan
                       yellow
                       blue-warmer
                       red-warmer
                       green-cooler
                       yellow-faint)))

   With 8 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 8)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list blue
                       magenta
                       magenta-cooler
                       cyan-cooler
                       fg-main
                       blue-warmer
                       red-cooler
                       cyan)))

   And this is with 4 colors, which produces results that are the
closest to the themes’ default aesthetic:

     (setq prism-num-faces 4)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list blue
                       magenta
                       magenta-cooler
                       green-warmer)))

   If you need to apply desaturation and lightening, you can use what
the ‘prism.el’ documentation recommends, like this (adapting to the
examples with the 4, 8, 16 colors):

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :lightens (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       cyan-cooler
                       magenta-cooler
                       magenta)))

7.11 Note on company-mode overlay pop-up
========================================

By default, the ‘company-mode’ pop-up that lists completion candidates
is drawn using an overlay.  This creates alignment issues every time it
is placed above a piece of text that has a different height than the
default.

   The solution recommended by the project’s maintainer is to use an
alternative front-end for drawing the pop-up which draws child frames
instead of overlays.(1)(2)

   Also consider the ‘corfu’ package.

7.12 Note on ERC escaped color sequences
========================================

The built-in IRC client ‘erc’ has the ability to colorize any text using
escape sequences that start with ‘^C’ (inserted with ‘C-q C-c’) and are
followed by a number for the foreground and background.(1)  Possible
numbers are 0-15, with the first entry being the foreground and the
second the background, separated by a comma.  Like this ‘^C1,6’.  The
minimum setup is this:

     (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'irccontrols)
     (setq erc-interpret-controls-p t
           erc-interpret-mirc-color t)

   As this allows users the chance to make arbitrary combinations, it is
impossible to guarantee a consistently high contrast ratio.  All we can
we do is provide guidance on the combinations that satisfy the
accessibility standard of the themes:

Modus Operandi
     Use foreground color 1 for all backgrounds from 2-15.  Like so:
     ‘C-q C-c1’ where ‘N’ is the background.

Modus Vivendi
     Use foreground color 0 for all backgrounds from 2-13.  Use
     foreground ‘1’ for backgrounds 14, 15.

   Colors 0 and 1 are white and black respectively.  So combine them
together, if you must.

======================

By default, packages that build on top of the Simple HTML Remember

user option ‘shr-use-fonts’, which is set to non-‘nil’ by default.  To
use the standard font instead, set that variable to nil.

   • ement

7.16 Note on Ement colors and fonts
===================================

The ‘ement.el’ library by Adam Porter (also known as “alphapapa”)
defaults to a method of colorizing usernames in a rainbow style.  This
is controlled by the user option ‘ement-room-prism’ and can be disabled
with:

     (setq ement-room-prism nil)

   The contrast ratio of these colors is governed by another user
option: ‘ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast’.  By default, it is set to 6
which is slightly below our nominal target.  Try this instead:

     (setq ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast 7)

   With regard to fonts, Ement depends on ‘shr’ (*note Note on SHR
fonts::).

   Since we are here, here is an excerpt from Ement’s source code:

     (defcustom ement-room-prism-minimum-contrast 6
       "Attempt to enforce this minimum contrast ratio for user faces.
     This should be a reasonable number from, e.g. 0-7 or so."
       ;; Prot would almost approve of this default.  :) I would go all the way
       ;; to 7, but 6 already significantly dilutes the colors in some cases.
       :type 'number)

   Yes, I do approve of that default.  Even a 4.5 (the WCAG AA rating)
would be a good baseline for many themes and/or user configurations.
Our target is the highest of the sort, though we do not demand that
everyone conforms with it.

7.17 Note on pdf-tools link hints
=================================

Hints are drawn by ImageMagick (https://imagemagick.org/), not Emacs,
i.e., ImageMagick doesn’t know about the hint face unless you tell
ImageMagick about it.  By default, only the foreground and background
color attributes are passed.  The below snippet adds to those the
various font attributes.  As it queries various faces, specifically
‘pdf-links-read-link’ and the faces it inherits, it needs to be added to
your initialization file after you’ve customized any faces.

     (use-package pdf-links
       :config
       (let ((spec

7.18 Note on the Notmuch logo
=============================

By default, the “hello” buffer of Notmuch includes a header with the
programs’ logo and a couple of buttons.  The logo has the effect of
enlarging the height of the line, which negatively impacts the shape of
those buttons.  Disabling the logo fixes the problem:

     (setq notmuch-show-logo nil)


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on goto-address-mode faces,  Prev: Note on the Notmuch logo,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.19 Note on goto-address-mode faces
====================================

The built-in ‘goto-address-mode’ uses heuristics to identify URLs and
email addresses in the current buffer.  It then applies a face to them
to change their style.  Some packages, such as ‘notmuch’, use this
minor-mode automatically.

   The faces are not declared with ‘defface’, meaning that it is better
that the theme does not modify them.  The user is thus encouraged to
consider including (or equivalent) this in their setup:

     (setq goto-address-url-face 'link
           goto-address-url-mouse-face 'highlight
           goto-address-mail-face 'link
           goto-address-mail-mouse-face 'highlight)

   My personal preference is to set ‘goto-address-mail-face’ to nil, as
it otherwise adds too much visual noise to the buffer (email addresses
stand out more, due to the use of the uncommon ‘@’ character but also
because they are often enclosed in angled brackets).

The minimum contrast ratio in relative luminance that the themes conform
with always refers to any given combination of background and foreground
colors.  If we have some blue colored text next to a magenta one, both
against a white background, we do not mean to imply that blue:magenta is
7:1 in terms of relative luminance.  Rather, we state that blue:white
and magenta:white each are 7:1 or higher.

   The point of reference is always the background.  Because colors have
about the same minimum distance in luminance from their backdrop, they
necessarily are fairly close to each other in this measure.  A possible
blue:magenta combination would naturally be around 1:1 in contrast of
the sort here considered.

   To differentiate between sequential colors, we rely on hueness by
mapping contrasting hues to adjacent constructs, while avoiding
exaggerations.  A blue next to a magenta can be told apart regardless of
their respective contrast ratio against their common background.
Exceptions would be tiny characters in arguably not so realistic cases,
such as two dots drawn side-by-side which for some reason would need to
be colored differently.  They would still be legible though, which is
the primary objective of the Modus themes.

8.2 What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?
=============================================

The Modus themes are designed with restraint, so that their default
looks do not overdo it with the application of color.

   *note Customization Options: Customization options.

   This is the non-quantifiable aspect of the themes’ design: the
artistic part, if you will.  There are a lot of cases where color can be
used inconsiderately, without accounting for layout, typographic, or
other properties of the presentation.  For example, two headings with
distinct markers, such as leading asterisks in Org buffers, do not have
to have highly contrasting hues between them in order to be told apart:
the added element of contrast in hueness does not contribute
significantly more to the distinction between the headings than colors
whose hues are relatively closer to each other in the color space.

   Exaggerations can be hard to anticipate or identify.  Multiple shades
of blue and magenta in the same context may not seem optimal: one might
think that it would be better to use highly contrasting hues to ensure
that all colors stand out, such as by placing blue next to yellow, next
to magenta, and green.  That would, however, be a case of design for its
own sake; a case where color is being applied without consideration of
its end results in the given context.  Too many contrasting hues in
close proximity force an erratic rate to how the eye jumps from one
piece of text to the next.  Whereas multiple shades of, say, blue and
magenta can suffice to tell things apart and avoid excess coloration: a
harmonious rhythm.

8.3 Why are colors mostly variants of blue, magenta, cyan?
==========================================================

Due to the innate properties of color, some options are better than
others for the accessibility purposes of the themes, the stylistic
consistency between ‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’, and the
avoidance of exaggerations in design.

   *note What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?::

   What we describe as color is a function of three distinct channels of
light: red, green, blue.  In hexadecimal RGB notation, a color value is
read as three pairs of red, green, and blue light: ‘#RRGGBB’.  Of those
three, the most luminant is green, while the least luminant is blue.

   The three basic colors represent each of the channels of light.  They
can be intermixed to give us six colors: red and green derive yellow,
green and blue make cyan, red and blue turn into magenta.

   We can test the luminance of each of those against white and black to
get a sense of how not all colors are equally good for accessibility
(white is ‘#ffffff’, which means that all three light channels are fully
luminated, while black is ‘#000000’ meaning that no light is present
(notwithstanding display technology)).

     | Name    |         | #ffffff | #000000 |
     |---------+---------+---------+---------|
     | red     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |    5.25 |
     | yellow  | #ffff00 |    1.07 |   19.56 |
     | green   | #00ff00 |    1.37 |   15.30 |
     | cyan    | #00ffff |    1.25 |   16.75 |
     | blue    | #0000ff |    8.59 |    2.44 |
     | magenta | #ff00ff |    3.14 |    6.70 |

   *note Measure color contrast::.

   By reading this table we learn that every color that has a high level
of green light (green, yellow, cyan) is virtually unreadable against a
white background and, conversely, can be easily read against black.

   We can then infer that red and blue, in different combinations, with
green acting as calibrator for luminance, will give us fairly moderate
colors that pass the 7:1 target.  Blue with a bit of green produce
appropriate variants of cyan.  Similarly, blue combined with some red
and hints of green give us suitable shades of purple.

   Due to the need of maintaining some difference in hueness between
adjacent colors, it is not possible to make red, green, and yellow the
main colors, because blue cannot be used to control their luminance and,
thus the relevant space will shrink considerably.

   *note Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?::

   This phenomenon is best illustrated by the following table that
measures the relative luminance of shades of red, yellow, magenta
against white:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #990000 |    8.92 |
     | #995500 |    5.75 |
     | #990099 |    7.46 |

   We notice that equal values of red and blue light in ‘#990099’
(magenta shade) do not lead to a considerable change in luminance
compared with ‘#990000’ (red variant).  Whereas less amount of green
light in ‘#995500’ leads to a major drop in luminance relative to white.
It follows that using the green channel of light to calibrate the
luminance of colors is more effective than trying to do the same with
either red or blue (the latter is the least effective in that regard).

   When we need to work with several colors, it is always better to have
sufficient manoeuvring space, especially since we cannot pick arbitrary
colors but only those that satisfy the accessibility objectives of the
themes.

   As for why we do not mostly use green, yellow, cyan for the dark
theme, it is because those colors are far more luminant than their
counterparts on the other side of the spectrum, so to ensure that they
all have about the same contrast ratios we would have to alter their
hueness considerably.  In short, the effect would not be optimal as it
would lead to exaggerations.  Plus, it would make ‘modus-vivendi’ look
completely different than ‘modus-operandi’, to the effect that the two
could not be properly considered part of the same project.

8.4 What is the best setup for legibility?
==========================================

The Modus themes can be conceptually simplified as combinations of color
values that account for relative luminance and inner harmony.  Those
qualities do not guarantee that every end-user will have the same
experience, due to differences between people, but also because of
variances in hardware capabilities and configurations.  For the purposes
of this document, we may only provide suggestions pertaining to the
latter case.

   ‘modus-operandi’ is best used outdoors or in a room that either gets
direct sunlight or has plenty of light.  Whereas ‘modus-vivendi’ works
better when there is not a lot of sunshine or the room has a source of
light that is preferably a faint and/or warm one.  It is possible to use
‘modus-operandi’ at night and ‘modus-vivendi’ during the day, though
that will depend on several variables, such as one’s overall perception
of color, the paint on the walls and how that contributes to the
impression of lightness in the room, the sense of space within the eye’s
peripheral vision, hardware specifications, and environmental factors.

   In general, an additional source of light other than that of the
monitor can help reduce eye strain: the eyes are more relaxed when they
do not have to focus on one point to gather light.

   The monitor’s display settings must be accounted for.  Gamma values,
in particular, need to be calibrated to neither amplify nor distort the
perception of black.  Same principle for sharpness, brightness, and
contrast as determined by the hardware, which all have an effect on how
text is read on the screen.

   There are software level methods on offer, such as the XrandR utility
for the X Window System (X.org), which can make gamma corrections for
each of the three channels of light (red, green, blue).  For example:

     xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 1.0 --gamma 0.76:0.75:0.68

   Typography is another variable.  Some font families are blurry at
small point sizes.  Others may have a regular weight that is lighter
(thiner) than that of their peers which may, under certain
circumstances, cause a halo effect around each glyph.

   The gist is that legibility cannot be fully solved at the theme
level.  The color combinations may have been optimized for
accessibility, though the remaining contributing factors in each case
need to be considered in full.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Are these color schemes?,  Next: Port the Modus themes to other platforms?,  Prev: What is the best setup for legibility?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

8.5 Are these color schemes?
============================

No, the Modus themes are not color schemes.

   A color scheme is a collection of colors.  A good color scheme is a
combination of colors with an inner logic or abstract structure.

   A theme is a set of patterns that are applied across different
contexts.  A good theme is one that does so with consistency, though not
uniformity.

   In practical terms, a color scheme is what one uses when, for
example, they replace the first sixteen escape sequences of a terminal
emulator with color values of their preference.  The terminal offers the
option to choose, say, the exact value of what counts as “red”, but does
not provide the means to control where that is mapped to and whether it
should also have other qualities such as a bold weight for the
underlying text or an added background color.  In contradistinction,
Emacs uses constructs known as “faces” which allow the user/developer to
specify where a given color will be used and whether it should be
accompanied by other typographic or stylistic attributes.

   By configuring the multitude of faces on offer we thus control both
which colors are applied and how they appear in their context.  When a
package wants to render each instance of “foo” with the “bar” face, it
is not requesting a specific color, which makes things considerably more
flexible as we can treat “bar” in its own right without necessarily
having to use some color value that we hardcoded somewhere.

   Which brings us to the distinction between consistency and uniformity
where our goal is always the former: we want things to look similar
across all interfaces, but we must never force a visual identity where
that runs contrary to the functionality of the given interface.  For
instance, all links are underlined by default yet there are cases such
as when viewing listings of emails in Gnus (and Mu4e, Notmuch) where (i)
it is already understood that one must follow the indicator or headline
to view its contents and (ii) underlining everything would make the
interface virtually unusable.

   Again, one must exercise judgement in order to avoid discrimination,
where “discrimination” refers to:

   • The treatment of substantially different magnitudes as if they were
     of the same class.
   • Or the treatment of the same class of magnitudes as if they were of
     a different class.

   (To treat similar things differently; to treat dissimilar things
alike.)

   If, in other words, one is to enforce uniformity without accounting
for the particular requirements of each case—the contextual demands for
usability beyond matters of color—they are making a not-so-obvious error
of treating different cases as if they were the same.

   The Modus themes prioritize “thematic consistency” over abstract
harmony or regularity among their applicable colors.  In concrete terms,
we do not claim that, say, our yellows are the best complements for our
blues because we generally avoid using complementary colors
side-by-side, so it is wrong to optimize for a decontextualised
blue+yellow combination.  Not to imply that our colors do not work well
together because they do, just to clarify that consistency of context is
what themes must strive for, and that requires widening the scope of the
design beyond the particularities of a color scheme.

   Long story short: color schemes and themes have different
requirements.  Please do not conflate the two.

8.6 Port the Modus themes to other platforms?
=============================================

There is no plan to port the themes to other platforms or text editors.
I (Protesilaos) only use GNU Emacs and thus cannot maintain code that
targets software I am either not familiar with or am not using on a
daily basis.

   While it is possible to produce a simulacrum based on a given
template, doing so would run contrary to how this project is maintained
where details matter greatly.

   Each program has its own requirements so it won’t always be
possible—or indeed desirable—to have 1:1 correspondence between what
applies to Emacs and what should be done elsewhere.  No port should ever
strive to be a copy of the Emacs implementation, as no other program is
an Emacs equivalent, but instead try to follow the spirit of the design.
For example, some of the customization options accept a list as their
value, or an alist, which may not be possible to reproduce on other
platforms.

   *note Customization options::.

   In other words, if something must be done differently on a certain
editor then that is acceptable so long as (i) the accessibility
standards are not compromised and (ii) the overall character of the
themes remains consistent.

   The former criterion should be crystal clear as it pertains to the
scientific foundations of the themes: high legibility and taking care of
the needs of users with red-green color deficiency (deuteranopia) by
avoiding red+green color coding paradigms and/or by providing
yellow+blue variants (*note Overview::).

   The latter criterion is the “je ne sais quoi” of the artistic aspect
of the themes, which is partially fleshed out in this manual.

   *note Frequently Asked Questions::.

   With regard to the artistic aspect (where “art” qua skill may amount
to an imprecise science), there is no hard-and-fast rule in effect as it
requires one to exercize discretion and make decisions based on
context-dependent information or constraints.  As is true with most
things in life, when in doubt, do not cling on to the letter of the law
but try to understand its spirit.

   For a trivial example: the curly underline that Emacs draws for
spelling errors is thinner than, e.g., what a graphical web browser has,
so if I was to design for an editor than has a thicker curly underline I
would make the applicable colors less intense to counterbalance the
typographic intensity of the added thickness.

   With those granted, if anyone is willing to develop a port of the
themes, they are welcome to contact me and I will do my best to help
them in their efforts.

9.3 Patches require copyright assignment to the FSF
===================================================

Code contributions are most welcome.  For any major edit (more than 15
lines, or so, in aggregate per person), you need to make a copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation.  This is necessary because
the themes are part of the upstream Emacs distribution: the FSF must at
all times be in a position to enforce the GNU General Public License.

   Copyright assignment is a simple process.  Check the request form
below (please adapt it accordingly).  You must write an email to the
address mentioned in the form and then wait for the FSF to send you a
legal agreement.  Sign the document and file it back to them.  This
could all happen via email and take about a week.  You are encouraged to
go through this process.  You only need to do it once.  It will allow
you to make contributions to Emacs in general.

     Please email the following information to assign@gnu.org, and we
     will send you the assignment form for your past and future changes.

     Please use your full legal name (in ASCII characters) as the subject
     line of the message.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
