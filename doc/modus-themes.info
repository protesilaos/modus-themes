1 Overview
**********

The Modus themes are designed for accessible readability.  They conform
with the highest standard for color contrast between any given
combination of background and foreground values.  This corresponds to
the WCAG AAA standard, which specifies a minimum rate of distance in
relative luminance of 7:1.

   Modus Operandi (‘modus-operandi’) is a light theme, while Modus
Vivendi (‘modus-vivendi’) is dark.  Each theme’s color palette is
designed to meet the needs of the numerous interfaces that are possible
in the Emacs computing environment.

   The overarching objective of this project is to always offer
accessible color combinations.  There shall never be a compromise on
this principle.  If there arises an inescapable trade-off between
readability and stylistic considerations, we will always opt for the
former.

   To ensure that users have a consistently accessible experience, the
themes strive to achieve as close to full face coverage as possible
(*note Face coverage::).

   Furthermore, the themes are designed to empower users with red-green
color deficiency (deuteranopia).  This is achieved through customization
options which have the effect of replacing all relevant instances of
green with a variant of blue (*note Customization Options::).

   Starting with version 0.12.0 and onwards, the themes are built into
GNU Emacs.

1.1 How do the themes look like
===============================

Check the web page with the screen shots
(https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes-pictures/).  There are lots of
scenarios on display that draw attention to details and important
aspects in the design of the themes.  They also showcase the numerous
customization options.

1.2 Learn about the latest changes
==================================

Please refer to the web page with the change log
(https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes-changelog).  It is comprehensive
and covers everything that goes into every tagged release of the themes.

2 Installation
**************

The Modus themes are distributed with Emacs starting with version 28.1.
On older versions of Emacs, they can be installed using Emacs’ package
manager or manually from their code repository.  There also exist
packages for distributions of GNU/Linux.

* Menu:

* Install manually from source::
* Install from the archives::
* Install on GNU/Linux::


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install manually from source,  Next: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.1 Install manually from source
================================

In the following example, we are assuming that your Emacs files are
stored in ‘~/.emacs.d’ and that you want to place the Modus themes in
‘~/.emacs.d/modus-themes’.

  1. Get the source and store it in the desired path by running the
     following in the command line shell:

     $ git clone https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes.git ~/.emacs.d/modus-themes

  1. Add that path to your known Elisp libraries’ list, by placing this
     snippet of Emacs Lisp in your init file (e.g.  ‘init.el’):

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/modus-themes")

   The themes are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install from the archives,  Next: Install on GNU/Linux,  Prev: Install manually from source,  Up: Installation

2.2 Install from the archives
=============================

The ‘modus-themes’ package is available from the GNU ELPA archive, which
is configured by default.

   Prior to querying any package archive, make sure to have updated the
index, with ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’.  Then all you need to do is
type ‘M-x package-install’ and specify the ‘modus-themes’.

   Note that older versions of the themes used to be distributed as
standalone packages.  This practice has been discontinued starting with
version 1.0.0 of this project.

   Once installed, the themes are ready to be used: *note Enable and
load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Install on GNU/Linux,  Prev: Install from the archives,  Up: Installation

2.3 Install on GNU/Linux
========================

The themes are also available from the archives of some distributions of
GNU/Linux.  These should correspond to a tagged release rather than
building directly from the latest Git commit.  It all depends on the
distro’s packaging policies.

* Menu:

* Debian 11 Bullseye::
* GNU Guix::


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Debian 11 Bullseye,  Next: GNU Guix,  Up: Install on GNU/Linux

2.3.1 Debian 11 Bullseye
------------------------

The themes are part of Debian 11 Bullseye.  Get them with:

     sudo apt install elpa-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: GNU Guix,  Prev: Debian 11 Bullseye,  Up: Install on GNU/Linux

2.3.2 GNU Guix
--------------

Users of Guix can get the themes with this command:

     guix package -i emacs-modus-themes

   They are now ready to be used: *note Enable and load::.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Enable and load,  Next: Customization Options,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Enable and load
*****************

Users of the built-in themes can load and automatically enable the theme
of their preference by adding either form to their init file:

     (load-theme 'modus-operandi)            ; Light theme
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi)             ; Dark theme

   This is all one needs.

   Users of packaged variants of the themes must add a few more lines to
ensure that everything works as intended.  First, one has to require the
main library before loading either theme:

     (require 'modus-themes)

   Then it is recommended to load the individual theme files with the
helper function ‘modus-themes-load-themes’:

     ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme (else you get an error).
     (modus-themes-load-themes)

   Once the libraries that define the themes are enabled, one can
activate a theme with either of the following expressions:

     (modus-themes-load-operandi)            ; Light theme
     ;; OR
     (modus-themes-load-vivendi)             ; Dark theme

   Changes to the available customization options must always be
evaluated before loading a theme (*note Customization Options::).  This
is how a basic setup could look like:

     (require 'modus-themes)

     ;; Your customisations here.  For example:
     (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs t
           modus-themes-mode-line '3d)

     ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme (else you get an error).
     (modus-themes-load-themes)

     ;; Enable the theme of your preference:
     (modus-themes-load-operandi)

     ;; Optionally add a key binding for the toggle between the themes:
     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") #'modus-themes-toggle)

   *note Sample configuration for use-package::.

   With those granted, bear in mind a couple of technical points on
‘modus-themes-load-operandi’ and ‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’, as well as
‘modus-themes-toggle’ which relies on them:

  1. Those functions call ‘load-theme’.  Some users prefer to opt for
     ‘enable-theme’ instead (*note Differences between loading and
     enabling::).

  2. The functions will run the ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’ as
     their final step.  This can be employed for bespoke configurations
     (*note Advanced customization (do-it-yourself)::).  Experienced
     users may not wish to rely on such a hook and the functions that
     run it: they may prefer a custom solution (*note A theme-agnostic
     hook for theme loading: A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading
     (DIY).).

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Sample configuration for use-package,  Next: Differences between loading and enabling,  Up: Enable and load

3.1 Sample configuration for use-package
========================================

It is common for Emacs users to rely on ‘use-package’ for declaring
package configurations in their setup.  We use this as an example:

     (use-package modus-themes
       :ensure                         ; omit this to use the built-in themes
       :init
       ;; Add all your customizations prior to loading the themes
       (setq modus-themes-slanted-constructs t
             modus-themes-bold-constructs nil
             modus-themes-region 'no-extend)

       ;; Load the theme files before enabling a theme (else you get an error).
       (modus-themes-load-themes)
       :config
       ;; Load the theme of your choice:
       (modus-themes-load-operandi) ;; OR (modus-themes-load-vivendi)
       :bind ("<f5>" . modus-themes-toggle))

   *note Differences between loading and enabling::.

   Note: make sure not to customize the variable
‘custom-theme-load-path’ or ‘custom-theme-directory’ after the themes’
package declaration.  That will lead to failures in loading the files.
If either or both of those variables need to be changed, their values
should be defined before the package declaration of the themes.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Differences between loading and enabling,  Prev: Sample configuration for use-package,  Up: Enable and load

3.2 Differences between loading and enabling
============================================

The reason we recommend ‘load-theme’ instead of the other option of
‘enable-theme’ is that the former does a kind of “reset” on the face
specs.  It quite literally loads (or re-loads) the theme.  Whereas the
latter simply puts an already loaded theme at the top of the list of
enabled items, re-using whatever state was last loaded.

   As such, ‘load-theme’ reads all customizations that may happen during
any given Emacs session: even after the initial setup of a theme.
Examples are calls to ‘custom-set-faces’, as well as new values assigned
to the options the Modus themes provide (*note Customization Options::).

   Our tests show that ‘enable-theme’ does not read such variables anew,
so it might appear to the unsuspecting user that the themes are somehow
broken whenever they try to assign a new value to a customization option
or some face.

   This “reset” that ‘load-theme’ conducts does, however, come at the
cost of being somewhat slower than ‘enable-theme’.  Users who have a
stable setup and who seldom update their variables during a given Emacs
session, are better off using something like this:

     (require 'modus-themes)
     (load-theme 'modus-operandi t t)
     (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t t)

     (enable-theme 'modus-operandi) ;; OR (enable-theme 'modus-vivendi)

   *note Sample configuration for use-package::.

   With the above granted, other sections of the manual discuss how to
configure custom faces, where ‘load-theme’ is expected, though
‘enable-theme’ could still apply in stable setups:

   *note Case-by-case face specs using the themes’ palette: Case-by-case
face specs using the themes' palette (DIY).

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes’ palette: Face specs at
scale using the themes' palette (DIY).

4 Customization Options
***********************

The Modus themes are highly configurable, though they should work well
without any further tweaks.  By default, all customization options are
set to nil.

   Remember that all customization options must be evaluated before
loading a theme (*note Enable and load::).

4.1 Option for color-coding success state (deuteranopia)
========================================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-success-deuteranopia’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to colorise all faces that denote “success”, “done”,
or similar with a variant of green.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’), use variants of blue instead of green.
This is meant to empower users with red-green color deficiency.

   The present customization option should apply to all contexts where
there can be a color-coded distinction between success and failure,
to-do and done, and so on.

   Diffs, which have a red/green dichotomy by default, can also be
configured to conform with deuteranopia.

   *note Option for diff buffer looks: Diffs.

4.2 Option for more bold constructs
===================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-bold-constructs’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to use a bold typographic weight only when it is
required.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) display several syntactic constructs in
bold weight.  This concerns keywords and other important aspects of code
syntax.  It also affects certain mode line indicators and command-line
prompts.

4.3 Option for more slanted constructs
======================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-slanted-constructs’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to not use slanted text (italics) unless it is
absolutely necessary.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) choose to render more faces in slanted
text.  This typically affects documentation strings and code comments.

4.4 Option for syntax highlighting
==================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-syntax’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘faint’
  3. ‘yellow-comments’
  4. ‘green-strings’
  5. ‘yellow-comments-green-strings’
  6. ‘alt-syntax’
  7. ‘alt-syntax-yellow-comments’
  8. ‘faint-yellow-comments’

   The default style (nil) for code syntax highlighting is a balanced
combination of colors on the cyan-blue-magenta side of the spectrum.
There is little to no use of greens, yellows, or reds, except when it is
necessary.

   Option ‘faint’ is like the default in terms of the choice of palette
but applies desaturated color values.

   Option ‘yellow-comments’ adds a yellow tint to comments.  The rest of
the syntax is the same as the default.

   Option ‘green-strings’ replaces the blue/cyan/cold color variants in
strings with greener alternatives.  The rest of the syntax remains the
same.

   Option ‘yellow-comments-green-strings’ combines yellow comments with
green strings and the rest of the default syntax highlighting style.

   Option ‘alt-syntax’ expands the active spectrum by applying color
combinations with more contrasting hues between them.  Expect to find
red and green variants in addition to cyan, blue, magenta.

   Option ‘alt-syntax-yellow-comments’ combines ‘alt-syntax’ with
‘yellow-comments’.

   Option ‘faint-yellow-comments’ combines the ‘faint’ style with
‘yellow-comments’.

4.5 Option for no font mixing
=============================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-no-mixed-fonts’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   By default, the themes configure some spacing-sensitive faces like
Org tables and code blocks to always inherit from the ‘fixed-pitch’
face.  This is to ensure that those constructs remain monospaced even
when users opt for a mode that remaps typeface families, such as the
built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’.  Otherwise the layout would appear
broken, due to how spacing is done.  To disable this behaviour, set the
option to ‘t’.

   Users may prefer to use another package for handling mixed typeface
configurations, rather than letting the theme do it, perhaps because a
purpose-specific package has extra functionality.  Two possible options
are ‘org-variable-pitch’ and ‘mixed-pitch’.

   *note Font configurations for Org and others: Font configurations for
Org and others (DIY).

4.6 Option for links
====================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-links’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘faint’
  3. ‘neutral-underline’
  4. ‘faint-neutral-underline’
  5. ‘no-underline’
  6. ‘underline-only’
  7. ‘neutral-underline-only’

   The default style (nil) for links is to apply an underline and a
saturated color to the affected text.  The color of the two is the same,
which makes the link fairly prominent.

   Option ‘faint’ follows the same approach as the default, but uses
less intense colors.

   Option ‘neutral-underline’ changes the underline’s color to a subtle
gray, while retaining the default text color.

   Option ‘faint-neutral-underline’ combines a desaturated text color
with a subtle gray underline.

   Option ‘no-underline’ removes link underlines altogether, while
retaining their original fairly vivid color.

   Option ‘underline-only’ applies a prominent underline while making
the affected text colorless (it uses the same foreground as the theme’s
default).

   Option ‘neutral-underline-only’ makes the text colorless while using
a subtle gray underline below it.

   NOTE: The placement of the underline, i.e.  its proximity to the
affected text, is controlled by the built-in
‘x-underline-at-descent-line’, ‘x-use-underline-position-properties’,
‘underline-minimum-offset’.  Please refer to their documentation
strings.

4.7 Option for command prompt styles
====================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-prompts’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘subtle-accented’ (‘subtle’ exists for backward compatibility)
  3. ‘intense-accented’ (‘intense’ exists for backward compatibility)
  4. ‘subtle-gray’
  5. ‘intense-gray’

   The default does not use any background for minibuffer and command
line prompts.  It relies exclusively on an accented foreground color.

   Options ‘subtle-accented’ and ‘intense-accented’ will change both the
background and the foreground values to use accented color combinations
that follow the hue of the default styles’ foreground (e.g.  the default
minibuffer prompt is cyan text, so these combinations will involved a
cyan background and an appropriate cyan foreground).  The difference
between the two is that the latter has a more pronounced/noticeable
effect than the former.

   Options ‘subtle-gray’, ‘intense-gray’ are like their accented
counterparts, except they use grayscale values.

4.8 Option for mode line presentation
=====================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mode-line’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘3d’
  3. ‘moody’
  4. ‘borderless’
  5. ‘borderless-3d’
  6. ‘borderless-moody’
  7. ‘accented’
  8. ‘accented-3d’
  9. ‘accented-moody’

   The default produces a two-dimensional effect both for the active and
inactive mode lines.  The differences between the two are limited to
distinct shades of grayscale values, with the active being more intense
than the inactive.

   Option ‘3d’ will make the active mode line look like a
three-dimensional rectangle.  Inactive mode lines remain 2D, though they
are slightly toned down relative to the default.  This aesthetic is
virtually the same as what you get when you run Emacs without any
customizations (‘emacs -Q’ on the command line).

   While ‘moody’ removes all box effects from the mode lines and applies
underline and overline properties instead.  It also tones down a bit the
inactive mode lines.  This is meant to optimize things for use with the
moody package (https://github.com/tarsius/moody) (hereinafter referred
to as “Moody”), though it can work fine even without it.

   The ‘borderless’ option uses the same colors as the default (nil
value), but removes the border effect.  This is done by making the box
property use the same color as the background, effectively blending the
two and creating some padding.

   The ‘borderless-3d’ and ‘borderless-moody’ approximate the ‘3d’ and
‘moody’ options respectively, while removing the borders.  However, to
ensure that the inactive mode lines remain visible, they apply a
slightly more prominent background to them than what their counterparts
do (same inactive background as with the default).

   Similarly, ‘accented’, ‘accented-3d’, and ‘accented-moody’ correspond
to the default (‘nil’), ‘3d’, and ‘moody’ styles respectively, except
that the active mode line uses a colored background instead of the
standard shade of gray.

   Note that Moody does not expose any faces that the themes could style
directly.  Instead it re-purposes existing ones to render its tabs and
ribbons.  As such, there may be cases where the contrast ratio falls
below the 7:1 target that the themes conform with (WCAG AAA). To hedge
against this, we configure a fallback foreground for the ‘moody’ option,
which will come into effect when the background of the mode line changes
to something less accessible, such as Moody ribbons (read the doc string
of ‘set-face-attribute’, specifically ‘:distant-foreground’).  This
fallback is activated when Emacs determines that the background and
foreground of the given construct are too close to each other in terms
of color distance.  In effect, users would need to experiment with the
variable ‘face-near-same-color-threshold’ to trigger the effect.  We
find that a value of ‘45000’ will suffice, contrary to the default
‘30000’.  Though for the ‘accented-moody’ value mentioned above, that
should be raised up to ‘70000’.  Do not set it too high, because it has
the adverse effect of always overriding the default colors (which have
been carefully designed to be highly accessible).

   Furthermore, because Moody expects an underline and overline instead
of a box style, it is advised you include this in your setup:

     (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)

4.9 Option for completion framework aesthetics
==============================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-completions’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘moderate’
  3. ‘opinionated’

   This is a special option that has different effects depending on the
completion UI.  The interfaces can be grouped in two categories, based
on their default aesthetics: (i) those that only or mostly use
foreground colors for their interaction model, and (ii) those that
combine background and foreground values for some of their metaphors.
The former category encompasses Icomplete, Ido, Selectrum, Vertico, as
well as pattern matching styles like Orderless and Flx.  The latter
covers Helm, Ivy, and Sallet.

   A value of ‘nil’ (the default) will simply respect the metaphors of
each completion framework.

   Option ‘moderate’ applies a combination of background and foreground
that is fairly subtle.  For Icomplete and friends this constitutes a
departure from their default aesthetics, however the difference is
small.  While Helm, Ivy et al appear slightly different than their
original looks, as they are toned down a bit.

   Option ‘opinionated’ uses color combinations that refashion the
completion UI.  For the Icomplete camp this means that intense
background and foreground combinations are used: in effect their looks
emulate those of Helm, Ivy and co.  in their original style.  Whereas
the other group of packages will revert to an even more nuanced
aesthetic with some additional changes to the choice of hues.

   To appreciate the scope of this customization option, you should
spend some time with every one of the ‘nil’ (default), ‘moderate’, and
‘opinionated’ possibilities.

4.10 Option for mail citations
==============================

[ Part of 1.4.0-dev ]

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-mail-citations’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘faint’
  3. ‘monochrome’

   By default, citations in email-related buffers apply contrasting hues
to different levels of depth in cited text.  The colors are fairly easy
to tell apart.

   A value of ‘faint’ makes all citation levels less intense, while
retaining the default style of contrasting hues (albeit very subtle
ones).

   Option ‘monochrome’ turns all citations in to a uniform shade of
gray.

   Whatever the value assigned to this variable, citations in emails are
controlled by typographic elements or indentation, which the themes do
not touch.

=================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-fringes’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘subtle’
  3. ‘intense’

   The default is to use the same color as that of the main background,
meaning that the fringes are not obvious though they still occupy the
space given to them by ‘fringe-mode’.

   Options ‘subtle’ and ‘intense’ apply a gray background, making the
fringes visible.  The difference between the two is one of degree, as
their names imply.

4.12 Option for language checkers
=================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-lang-checkers’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘subtle-foreground’
  3. ‘intense-foreground’
  4. ‘straight-underline’
  5. ‘subtle-foreground-straight-underline’
  6. ‘intense-foreground-straight-underline’
  7. ‘colored-background’

   Nil (the default) applies a color-coded underline to the affected
text, while it leaves the original foreground in tact.  If the display
spec where Emacs runs in has support for it (e.g.  Emacs GUI), the
underline’s style is that of a wave, otherwise it is a straight line.

   Options ‘subtle-foreground’ and ‘intense-foreground’ follow the same
color-coding pattern and wavy underline of the default, while extending
it with a corresponding foreground value for the affected text.  The
difference between the two options is one of degree, as their names
suggest.

   Option ‘straight-underline’ is like the default but always applies a
straight line under the affected text.  Same principle for
‘subtle-foreground-straight-underline’ and its counterpart
‘intense-foreground-straight-underline’.

   Option ‘colored-background’ uses a straight underline, a tinted
background, and a suitable foreground.  All are color-coded.  This is
the most intense combination of face properties.

   The present variable affects packages and/or face groups such as
those of ‘flyspell’, ‘flymake’, ‘flycheck’, ‘artbollocks-mode’, and
‘writegood-mode’.

   NOTE: The placement of the straight underline, though not the wave
style, is controlled by the built-in ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’,
‘x-use-underline-position-properties’, ‘underline-minimum-offset’.
Please refer to their documentation strings.

4.13 Option for line highlighting (hl-line-mode)
================================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-hl-line’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘intense-background’
  3. ‘accented-background’ (made more prominent for 1.4.0-dev)
  4. ‘underline-neutral’
  5. ‘underline-accented’
  6. ‘underline-only-neutral’
  7. ‘underline-only-accented’

   The default is to use a subtle gray background for the current line
when ‘hl-line-mode’ is enabled.

   The ‘intense-background’ applies a more prominent gray to the
background of the current line.

   With ‘accented-background’ the background gets a colored hint and is
more prominent than the default.

   The ‘underline-neutral’ combines the default subtle neutral
background with a gray underline.

   Similarly, the ‘underline-accented’ renders the background of the
current line in a subtle colored background, while it also draws an
accented underline.

   Option ‘underline-only-neutral’ produces a neutral underline, but
does not use any background.

   While ‘underline-only-accented’ also uses just an underline, only
this one is colored.

   Consider setting the variable ‘x-underline-at-descent-line’ to a
non-nil value for better results with underlines.

   This style affects several packages that enable ‘hl-line-mode’, such
as ‘elfeed’ and ‘mu4e’.

4.14 Option for line numbers (display-line-numbers-mode)
========================================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-subtle-line-numbers’

   Possible value:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default style for ‘display-line-numbers-mode’ and its global
variant is to apply a subtle gray background to the line numbers.  The
current line has a more pronounced background and foreground combination
to bring more attention to itself.

   Similarly, the faces for ‘display-line-numbers-major-tick’ and its
counterpart ‘display-line-numbers-minor-tick’ use appropriate styles
that involve a bespoke background and foreground combination.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’), line numbers have no background of their
own.  Instead they retain the primary background of the theme, blending
with the rest of the buffer.  Foreground values for all relevant faces
are updated to accommodate this aesthetic.

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘subtle-bold’
  3. ‘intense’
  4. ‘intense-bold’

   Nil means to use a subtle tinted background color for the matching
delimiters.

   Option ‘intense’ applies a saturated background color.

   Option ‘subtle-bold’ is the same as the default, but also makes use
of bold typographic weight (inherits the ‘bold’ face).

   Option ‘intense-bold’ is the same as ‘intense’, while it also uses a
bold weight.

   This customization variable affects tools such as the built-in
‘show-paren-mode’ and the ‘smartparens’ package.

  2. ‘no-extend’
  3. ‘bg-only’
  4. ‘bg-only-no-extend’
  5. ‘accent’
  6. ‘accent-no-extend’

   Nil means to only use a prominent gray background with a neutral
foreground.  The foreground overrides all syntax highlighting.  The
region extends to the edge of the window.

   Option ‘no-extend’ preserves the default aesthetic but prevents the
region from extending to the edge of the window.

   Option ‘bg-only’ applies a faint tinted background that is distinct
from all others used in the theme, while it does not override any
existing colors.  It extends to the edge of the window.

   Option ‘bg-only-no-extend’ is a combination of the ‘bg-only’ and
‘no-extend’ options.

   Option ‘accent’ is like the default, though it uses a more colorful
background, while ‘accent-no-extend’ is the same except it draws the
region only up to the end of each line instead of extending to the edge
of the window.

4.17 Option for diff buffer looks
=================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-diffs’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘desaturated’
  3. ‘bg-only’
  4. ‘deuteranopia’
  5. ‘fg-only-deuteranopia’ (part of 1.4.0-dev)
  6. ‘fg-only’ (became an alias of ‘fg-only-deuteranopia’—part of
     1.4.0-dev)

   The default (‘nil’) uses fairly intense color combinations for diffs,
by applying prominently colored backgrounds, with appropriate
foregrounds.

   Option ‘desaturated’ follows the same principles as with the default
(‘nil’), though it tones down all relevant colors.

   Option ‘bg-only’ applies a background but does not override the
text’s foreground.  This makes it suitable for a non-nil value passed to
‘diff-font-lock-syntax’ (note: Magit does not support syntax
highlighting in diffs—last checked on 2021-04-21).

   Option ‘deuteranopia’ is like the default (‘nil’) in terms of using
prominently colored backgrounds, except that it also accounts for
red-green color defficiency by replacing all instances of green with
colors on the blue side of the spectrum.  Other stylistic changes are
made in the interest of optimizing for such a use-case.

   Option ‘fg-only-deuteranopia’ removes all colored backgrounds, except
from word-wise or refined changes.  Instead, it only uses color-coded
foreground values to differentiate between added, removed, and changed
lines.  If a background is necessary to denote context, a subtle
grayscale value is applied.  The color used for added lines is a variant
of blue to account for red-green color defficiency but also because
green text alone is hard to discern in the diff’s context (hard for our
accessibility purposes).  The ‘fg-only’ option that existed in older
versions of the themes is now an alias of ‘fg-only-deuteranopia’, in the
interest of backward compatibility.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Org mode blocks,  Next: Org agenda habits,  Prev: Diffs,  Up: Customization Options

4.18 Option for org-mode block styles
=====================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘gray-background’ (part of 1.4.0-dev—value ‘grayscale’ exists for
     backward compatibility)
  3. ‘tinted-background’ (part of 1.4.0-dev—value ‘rainbow’ exists for
     backward compatibility)

   The default means that the block has no distinct background of its
own and uses the one that applies to the rest of the buffer.

   Option ‘gray-background’ applies a subtle gray background to the
block’s contents.  It also affects the begin and end lines of the block:
their background extends to the edge of the window for Emacs version >=
27 where the ‘:extend’ keyword is recognized by ‘set-face-attribute’
(this is contingent on the variable
‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’).

   Option ‘tinted-background’ uses a slightly colored background for the
contents of the block.  The exact color will depend on the programming
language and is controlled by the variable ‘org-src-block-faces’ (refer
to the theme’s source code for the current association list).  For this
to take effect, Org must be restarted with ‘M-x org-mode-restart’.

   Code blocks use their major mode’s colors only when the variable
‘org-src-fontify-natively’ is non-nil.  While quote/verse blocks require
setting ‘org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks’ to a non-nil value.

   *note Update Org block delimiter fontification: Update Org block
delimiter fontification (DIY).

   Older versions of the themes provided options ‘grayscale’ (or
‘greyscale’) and ‘rainbow’.  Those will continue to work as they are
aliases for ‘gray-background’ and ‘tinted-background’, respectively.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Org agenda habits,  Next: Heading styles,  Prev: Org mode blocks,  Up: Customization Options

4.19 Option for org-habit graph styles
======================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-org-habit’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘simplified’
  3. ‘traffic-light’

   The default is meant to conform with the original aesthetic of
‘org-habit’.  It employs all four color codes that correspond to the
org-habit states—clear, ready, alert, and overdue—while distinguishing
between their present and future variants.  This results in a total of
eight colors in use: red, yellow, green, blue, in tinted and shaded
versions.  They cover the full set of information provided by the
‘org-habit’ consistency graph.

   Option ‘simplified’ is like the default except that it removes the
dichotomy between current and future variants by applying uniform
color-coded values.  It applies a total of four colors: red, yellow,
green, blue.  They produce a simplified consistency graph that is more
legible (or less “busy”) than the default.  The intent is to shift focus
towards the distinction between the four states of a habit task, rather
than each state’s present/future outlook.

   Option ‘traffic-light’ further reduces the available colors to red,
yellow, and green.  As in ‘simplified’, present and future variants
appear uniformly, but differently from it, the ’clear’ state is rendered
in a green hue, instead of the original blue.  This is meant to capture
the use-case where a habit task being “too early” is less important than
it being “too late”.  The difference between ready and clear states is
attenuated by painting both of them using shades of green.  This option
thus highlights the alert and overdue states.

4.20 Option for the headings’ overall style
===========================================

This is defined as an alist and, therefore, uses a different approach
than other customization options documented in this manual.

   Symbol: ‘modus-themes-headings’

   Possible values, which can be specified for each heading level N
(examples further below):

   • ‘nil’ (‘t’ is also available for backward compatibility)
   • ‘no-bold’
   • ‘line’
   • ‘line-no-bold’
   • ‘rainbow’
   • ‘rainbow-line’
   • ‘rainbow-line-no-bold’
   • ‘highlight’
   • ‘highlight-no-bold’
   • ‘rainbow-highlight’
   • ‘rainbow-highlight-no-bold’
   • ‘section’
   • ‘section-no-bold’
   • ‘rainbow-section’
   • ‘rainbow-section-no-bold’
   • ‘no-color’
   • ‘no-color-no-bold’

   To control faces per level from 1-8, use something like this:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . section)
             (2 . section-no-bold)
             (3 . rainbow-line)
             (t . rainbow-line-no-bold)))

   The above uses the ‘section’ value for heading levels 1,
‘section-no-bold’ for headings 2, ‘rainbow-line’ for 3.  All other
levels fall back to ‘rainbow-line-no-bold’.

   To set a uniform value for all heading levels, use this pattern:

     ;; A given style for every heading
     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((t . section)))

     ;; Default aesthetic for every heading
     (setq modus-themes-headings nil)

   The default style for headings uses a fairly desaturated foreground
color in combination with bold typographic weight.  To specify this
style for a given level N, assuming you wish to have another fallback
option, just assign the value ‘nil’ like this:

     (setq modus-themes-headings
           '((1 . nil)
             (2 . line)
             (3) ; same as nil
             (t . rainbow-line-no-bold)))

   A description of all other possible styles beyond the default:

   • ‘no-bold’ retains the default text color while removing the bold
     typographic weight.

   • ‘line’ is the same as the default plus an overline across the
     heading’s length.

   • ‘line-no-bold’ is the same as ‘line’ without bold weight.

   • ‘rainbow’ uses a more colorful foreground in combination with bold
     typographic weight.

   • ‘rainbow-line’ is the same as ‘rainbow’ plus an overline.

   • ‘rainbow-line-no-bold’ is the same as ‘rainbow-line’ without the
     bold weight.

   • ‘highlight’ retains the default style of a fairly desaturated
     foreground combined with a bold weight and adds to it a subtle
     accented background.

   • ‘highlight-no-bold’ is the same as ‘highlight’ without a bold
     weight.

   • ‘rainbow-highlight’ is the same as ‘highlight’ but with a more
     colorful foreground.

   • ‘rainbow-highlight-no-bold’ is the same as ‘rainbow-highlight’
     without a bold weight.

   • ‘section’ retains the default looks and adds to them both an
     overline and a slightly accented background.  It is, in effect, a
     combination of the ‘line’ and ‘highlight’ values.

   • ‘section-no-bold’ is the same as ‘section’ without a bold weight.

   • ‘rainbow-section’ is the same as ‘section’ but with a more colorful
     foreground.

   • ‘rainbow-section-no-bold’ is the same as ‘rainbow-section’ without
     a bold weight.

   • ‘no-color’ does not apply any color to the heading, meaning that it
     uses the foreground of the ‘default’ face.  It still renders the
     text with a bold typographic weight.

   • ‘no-color-no-bold’ is like ‘no-color’ but without the bold weight.

   Remember to also inspect relevant variables that Org provides, such
as: ‘org-fontify-whole-heading-line’ and ‘org-fontify-done-headline’.

4.21 Option for scaled headings
===============================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-scale-headings’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   The default is to use the same size for headings and paragraph text.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) make headings larger in height relative to
the main text.  This is noticeable in modes like Org, Markdown, and
Info.

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Scaled heading sizes,  Up: Scaled headings

4.21.1 Control the scale of headings
------------------------------------

In addition to the toggle for enabling scaled headings, users can also
specify a number of their own.

   • If it is a floating point, say, ‘1.5’, it is interpreted as a
     multiple of the base font size.  This is the recommended method,
     because it will always adapt to changes in the base font size, such
     as while using the ‘text-scale-adjust’ command.

   • If it is an integer, it is read as an absolute font height that is
     1/10 of the typographic point size.  Thus a value of ‘18pt’ must be
     expressed as ‘180’.  Setting an absolute value is discouraged, as
     it will break the layout in cases where the base font size must
     change, such as with the ‘text-scale-adjust’ command (*note Font
     configurations: Font configurations for Org and others (DIY).).
     While we discourage using absolute values, we still provide for
     this option for users who do not need to perform text-scaling
     operations or who are content with whatever discrepancies in
     height.

   Below are the variables in their default values, using the floating
point paradigm.  The numbers are very conservative, but one is free to
change them to their liking, such as ‘1.2’, ‘1.4’, ‘1.6’, ‘1.8’,
‘2.0’—or use a resource for finding a consistent scale:

     (setq modus-themes-scale-1 1.05
           modus-themes-scale-2 1.1
           modus-themes-scale-3 1.15
           modus-themes-scale-4 1.2
           modus-themes-scale-5 1.3)

   As for the application of that scale, the variables that range from
‘modus-themes-scale-1’ up to ‘modus-themes-scale-4’ apply to regular
headings within the context of the given major mode.  The former is the
smallest, while the latter is the largest.  “Regular headings” are those
that have a standard syntax for their scale, such as Org mode’s eight
levels of asterisks or Markdown’s six columns.

   Whereas ‘modus-themes-scale-5’ is applied to special headings that do
not conform with the aforementioned syntax, yet which are expected to be
larger than the largest value on that implied scale.  Put concretely,
Org’s ‘#+title’ meta datum is not part of the eight levels of headings
in an Org file, yet is supposed to signify the primary header.
Similarly, the Org Agenda’s structure headings are not part of a
recognisable scale and so they also get ‘modus-themes-scale-5’.

   Users who wish to maintain scaled headings for the normal syntax
while preventing special headings from standing out, can assign a value
of ‘1.0’ to ‘modus-themes-scale-5’ to make it the same as body text (or
whatever value would render it indistinguishable from the desired point
of reference).

   Note that in earlier versions of Org, scaling would only increase the
size of the heading, but not of keywords that were added to it, like
“TODO”.  The issue has been fixed upstream:

4.22 Option for variable-pitch font in UI elements
==================================================

Symbol: ‘modus-themes-variable-pitch-ui’

   Possible values:

  1. ‘nil’ (default)
  2. ‘t’

   This option concerns User Interface elements that are under the
direct control of Emacs.  In particular: the mode line, header line, tab
bar, and tab line.

   The default is to use the same font as the rest of Emacs, which
usually is a monospaced family.

   With a non-nil value (‘t’) apply a proportionately spaced typeface.
This is done by assigning the ‘variable-pitch’ face to the relevant
items.

Unlike the predefined customization options which follow a clear pattern
of allowing the user to quickly specify their preference, the themes
also provide a more flexible, albeit difficult, mechanism to control
things with precision (*note Customization Options::).

   This section is of interest only to users who are prepared to
maintain their own local tweaks and who are willing to deal with any
possible incompatibilities between versioned releases of the themes.  As
such, they are labelled as “do-it-yourself” or “DIY”.

5.1 Per-theme customization settings (DIY)
==========================================

If you prefer to maintain different customization options between the
two themes, it is best you write your own functions that first set those
options and then load the relevant theme.  The following code does
exactly that by simply differentiating the two themes on the choice of
bold constructs in code syntax (enabled for one, disabled for the
other).

     (defun my-demo-modus-operandi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs t) ; ENABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-operandi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-vivendi ()
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-bold-constructs nil) ; DISABLE bold
       (modus-themes-load-vivendi))

     (defun my-demo-modus-themes-toggle ()
       (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-operandi)
           (my-demo-modus-vivendi)
         (my-demo-modus-operandi)))

   Then assign ‘my-demo-modus-themes-toggle’ to a key instead of the
equivalent the themes provide.

   For a more elaborate design, it is better to inspect the source code
of ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and relevant functions.

5.2 Case-by-case face specs using the themes’ palette (DIY)
===========================================================

This section is about tweaking individual faces.  If you plan to do
things at scale, consult the next section: *note Set multiple faces:
Face specs at scale using the themes' palette (DIY).

   We already covered in previous sections how to toggle between the
themes and how to configure options prior to loading.  We also explained
that some of the functions made available to users will fire up a hook
that can be used to pass tweaks in the post-theme-load phase.

   Now assume you wish to change a single face, say, the ‘cursor’.  And
you would like to get the standard “blue” color value of the active
Modus theme, whether it is Modus Operandi or Modus Vivendi.  To do that,
you can use the ‘modus-themes-color’ function.  It accepts a symbol that
is associated with a color in ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’.  Like this:

     (modus-themes-color 'blue)

   The function always extracts the color value of the active Modus
theme.

     (progn
       (load-theme 'modus-operandi t)
       (modus-themes-color 'blue))           ; "#0031a9" for `modus-operandi'

     (progn
       (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t)
       (modus-themes-color 'blue))           ; "#2fafff" for `modus-vivendi'

   Do ‘C-h v’ on the aforementioned variables to check all the available
symbols that can be passed to this function.

   With that granted, let us expand the example to actually change the
‘cursor’ face’s background property.  We employ the built-in function of
‘set-face-attribute’:

     (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color 'blue))

   If you evaluate this form, your cursor will become blue.  But if you
change themes, such as with ‘modus-themes-toggle’, your edits will be
lost, because the newly loaded theme will override the ‘:background’
attribute you had assigned to that face.

   For such changes to persist, we need to make them after loading the
theme.  So we rely on ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which gets
called from ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’, ‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’,
as well as the command ‘modus-themes-toggle’.  Here is a sample function
that tweaks two faces and then gets added to the hook:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color 'blue))
       (set-face-attribute 'font-lock-type-face nil :foreground (modus-themes-color 'magenta-alt)))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading: A theme-agnostic hook
for theme loading (DIY).

   Using this principle, it is possible to override the styles of faces
without having to find color values for each case.

   Another application is to control the precise weight for bold
constructs.  This is particularly useful if your typeface has several
variants such as “heavy”, “extrabold”, “semibold”.  All you have to do
is edit the ‘bold’ face.  For example:

     (set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold)

   Remember to use the custom function and hook combo we demonstrated
above.  Because the themes do not hard-wire a specific weight, this
simple form is enough to change the weight of all bold constructs
throughout the interface.

   Finally, there are cases where you want to tweak colors though wish
to apply different ones to each theme, say, a blue hue for Modus
Operandi and a shade of red for Modus Vivendi.  To this end, we provide
‘modus-themes-color-alts’ as a convenience function to save you from the
trouble of writing separate wrappers for each theme.  It still returns a
single value by querying either of ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’, only here you pass the two keys you want,
first for ‘modus-operandi’ then ‘modus-vivendi’.

   Take the previous example with the ‘cursor’ face:

     ;; Blue for `modus-operandi' and red for `modus-vivendi'
     (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background (modus-themes-color-alts 'blue 'red))

5.3 Face specs at scale using the themes’ palette (DIY)
=======================================================

The examples here are for large scale operations.  For simple, one-off
tweaks, you may prefer the approach documented in the previous section
(*note Case-by-case face specs using the themes’ palette: Case-by-case
face specs using the themes' palette (DIY).).

   The ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro lets you retrieve multiple color
values by employing the backquote/backtick and comma notation.  The
values are stored in the alists ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’, while the macro always queries that of
the active Modus theme.

   Here is an abstract example that just returns a list of color values
while ‘modus-operandi’ is enabled:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (list fg-main
             blue-faint
             magenta
             magenta-alt-other
             cyan-alt-other
             fg-special-cold
             blue-alt
             magenta-faint
             cyan
             fg-main
             green-faint
             red-alt-faint
             blue-alt-faint
             fg-special-warm
             cyan-alt
             blue))
     ;; =>
     ;; ("#000000" "#002f88" "#721045" "#5317ac"
     ;;  "#005a5f" "#093060" "#2544bb" "#752f50"
     ;;  "#00538b" "#000000" "#104410" "#702f00"
     ;;  "#003f78" "#5d3026" "#30517f" "#0031a9")

   Getting a list of colors may have its applications, though what you
are most likely interested in is how to use those variables to configure
several faces at once.  To do so we can rely on the built-in
‘custom-set-faces’ function, which sets face specifications for the
special ‘user’ theme.  That “theme” gets applied on top of regular
themes like ‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’.

   This is how it works:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(cursor ((,class :background ,blue)))
        `(mode-line ((,class :background ,yellow-nuanced-bg
                             :foreground ,yellow-nuanced-fg)))
        `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :background ,blue-nuanced-bg
                                      :foreground ,blue-nuanced-fg)))))

   The above snippet will immediately refashion the faces it names once
it is evaluated.  However, if you switch between the Modus themes, say,
from ‘modus-operandi’ to ‘modus-vivendi’, the colors will not get
updated to match those of the new theme.  To make things work across the
themes, we need to employ the same technique we discussed in the
previous section, namely, to pass our changes at the post-theme-load
phase via a hook.

   The themes provide the ‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which
gets called from ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’,
‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’, as well as the command
‘modus-themes-toggle’.  With this knowledge, you can wrap the macro in a
function and then assign that function to the hook.  Thus:

     (defun my-modus-themes-custom-faces ()
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (custom-set-faces
          `(cursor ((,class :background ,blue)))
          `(mode-line ((,class :background ,yellow-nuanced-bg
                               :foreground ,yellow-nuanced-fg)))
          `(mode-line-inactive ((,class :background ,blue-nuanced-bg
                                        :foreground ,blue-nuanced-fg))))))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-modus-themes-custom-faces)

   *note A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading: A theme-agnostic hook
for theme loading (DIY).

   To discover the faces defined by all loaded libraries, you may do
‘M-x list-faces-display’.  Be warned that when you ‘:inherit’ a face you
are introducing an implicit dependency, so try to avoid doing so for
libraries other than the built-in ‘faces.el’ (or at least understand
that things may break if you inherit from a yet-to-be-loaded face).

   Also bear in mind that these examples are meant to work with the
Modus themes.  If you are cycling between multiple themes you may
encounter unforeseen issues, such as the colors of the Modus themes
being applied to a non-Modus item.

   Finally, note that you can still use other functions where those make
sense.  For example, the ‘modus-themes-color-alts’ that was discussed in
the previous section.  Adapt the above example like this:

     ...
     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(cursor ((,class :background ,(modus-themes-color-alts 'blue 'green))))
        ...))

5.4 Remap face with local value (DIY)
=====================================

There are cases where we need to change the buffer-local attributes of a
face.  This might be because we have our own minor mode that re-uses a
face for a particular purpose, such as a line selection tool that
activates ‘hl-line-mode’, but we wish to keep it distinct from other
buffers.  This is where ‘face-remap-add-relative’ can be applied and may
be combined with ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ to deliver consistent
results.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes' palette (DIY)::.

   In this example we will write a simple interactive function that
adjusts the background color of the ‘region’ face.  This is the sample
code:

     (defvar my-rainbow-region-colors
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         `((red . ,red-subtle-bg)
           (green . ,green-subtle-bg)
           (yellow . ,yellow-subtle-bg)
           (blue . ,blue-subtle-bg)
           (magenta . ,magenta-subtle-bg)
           (cyan . ,cyan-subtle-bg)))
       "Sample list of color values for `my-rainbow-region'.")

     (defun my-rainbow-region (color)
       "Remap buffer-local attribute of `region' using COLOR."
       (interactive
        (list
         (completing-read "Pick a color: " my-rainbow-region-colors)))
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'region
        `( :background ,(alist-get (intern color) my-rainbow-region-colors)
           :foreground ,(face-attribute 'default :foreground))))

   When ‘my-rainbow-region’ is called interactively, it prompts for a
color to use.  The list of candidates is drawn from the car of each
association in ‘my-rainbow-region-colors’ (so “red”, “green”, etc.).

   To extend this principle, we may write wrapper functions that pass a
color directly.  Those can be useful in tandem with hooks.  Consider
this example:

     (defun my-rainbow-region-magenta ()
       (my-rainbow-region 'magenta))

     (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook #'my-rainbow-region-magenta)

   Whenever we enter a ‘diff-mode’ buffer, we now get a magenta-colored
region.

   Perhaps you may wish to generalise those findings in to a set of
functions that also accept an arbitrary face.  We shall leave the
experimentation up to you.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Cycle through arbitrary colors (DIY),  Next: Override colors (DIY),  Prev: Remap face with local value (DIY),  Up: Advanced customization (do-it-yourself)

5.5 Cycle through arbitrary colors (DIY)
========================================

Users may opt to customize individual faces of the themes to accommodate
their particular needs.  One such case is with the color intensity of
comments, specifically the foreground of ‘font-lock-comment-face’.  The
Modus themes set that to a readable value, in accordance with their
accessibility objective, though users may prefer to lower the overall
contrast on an on-demand basis.

   One way to achieve this is to design a command that cycles through
three distinct levels of intensity, though the following can be adapted
to any kind of cyclic behaviour, such as to switch between red, green,
and blue.

   In the following example, we employ the ‘modus-themes-color’ function
which reads a symbol that represents an entry in the active theme’s
color palette (*note Case-by-case face specs using the themes’ palette:
Case-by-case face specs using the themes' palette (DIY).). Those are
stored in ‘my-modus-themes-comment-colors’.

     (defvar my-modus-themes-comment-colors
       ;; We are abusing the palette here, as those colors have their own
       ;; purpose in the palette, so please ignore the semantics of their
       ;; names.
       '((low . bg-region)
         (medium . bg-tab-inactive-alt)
         (high . fg-alt))
       "Alist of levels of intensity mapped to color palette entries.
     The entries are found in `modus-themes-operandi-colors' or
     `modus-themes-vivendi-colors'.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state nil
       "The cyclic state of `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'.
     For internal use.")

     (defun my-modus-themes--comment-foreground (degree state)
       "Set `font-lock-comment-face' foreground.
     Use `my-modus-themes-comment-colors' to extract the color value
     for each level of intensity.

     This is complementary to `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'."
       (let ((palette-colors my-modus-themes-comment-colors))
         (set-face-foreground
          'font-lock-comment-face
          (modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors)))
         (setq my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state state)
         (message "Comments are set to %s contrast" degree)))

     (defun my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color ()
       "Cycle through levels of intensity for comments.
     The levels are determined by `my-modus-themes-comment-colors'."
       (interactive)
       (pcase my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state
         ('nil
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'low 1))
         (1
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'medium 2))
         (_
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'high nil))))

   With the above, ‘M-x my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color’ will cycle
through the three levels of intensity that have been specified.

   Another approach is to not read from the active theme’s color palette
and instead provide explicit color values, either in hexadecimal RGB
notation (like ‘#123456’) or as the names that are displayed in the
output of ‘M-x list-colors-display’.  In this case, the alist with the
colors will have to account for the active theme, so as to set the
appropriate colors.  While this introduces a bit more complexity, it
ultimately offers greater flexibility on the choice of colors for such a
niche functionality (so there is no need to abuse the palette of the
active Modus theme):

     (defvar my-modus-themes-comment-colors
       '((light . ((low . "gray75")
                   (medium . "gray50")
                   (high . "#505050")))      ; the default for `modus-operandi'

         (dark . ((low . "gray25")
                  (medium . "gray50")
                  (high . "#a8a8a8"))))      ; the default for `modus-vivendi'
       "Alist of levels of intensity mapped to color values.
     For such colors, consult the command `list-colors-display'.  Pass
     the name of a color or its hex value.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state nil
       "The cyclic state of `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'.
     For internal use.")

     (defun my-modus-themes--comment-foreground (degree state)
         "Set `font-lock-comment-face' foreground.
     Use `my-modus-themes-comment-colors' to extract the color value
     for each level of intensity.

     This is complementary to `my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color'."
       (let* ((colors my-modus-themes-comment-colors)
              (levels (pcase (car custom-enabled-themes)
                        ('modus-operandi (alist-get 'light colors))
                        ('modus-vivendi (alist-get 'dark colors)))))
         (set-face-foreground
          'font-lock-comment-face
          (alist-get degree levels))
         (setq my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state state)
         (message "Comments are set to %s contrast" degree)))

     (defun my-modus-themes-adjust-comment-color ()
       "Cycle through levels of intensity for comments.
     The levels are determined by `my-modus-themes-comment-colors'."
       (interactive)
       (pcase my-modus-themes--adjust-comment-color-state
         ('nil

          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'medium 2))
         (_
          (my-modus-themes--comment-foreground 'high nil))))

   The effect of the above configurations on ‘font-lock-comment-face’ is
global.  To make it buffer-local, one must tweak the code to employ the
function ‘face-remap-add-relative’ (*note Remap face with local value:
Remap face with local value (DIY).).

   So this form in ‘my-modus-themes--comment-foreground’:

     ;; example 1
     (...
      (set-face-foreground
       'font-lock-comment-face
       (modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors)))
      ...)

     ;; example 2
     (...
      (set-face-foreground
       'font-lock-comment-face
       (alist-get degree levels))
      ...)

   Must become this:

     ;; example 1
     (...
      (face-remap-add-relative
       'font-lock-comment-face
       `(:foreground ,(modus-themes-color (alist-get degree palette-colors))))
      ...)

     ;; example 2
     (...
      (face-remap-add-relative
       'font-lock-comment-face
       `(:foreground ,(alist-get degree levels)))
      ...)

5.6 Override colors (DIY)
=========================

The themes provide a mechanism for overriding their color values.  This
is controlled by the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’
and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’, which are alists that should
mirror a subset of the associations in ‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’
and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ respectively.  As with all
customisations, overriding must be done before loading the affected
theme.

   Let us approach the present topic one step at a time.  Here is a
simplified excerpt of the default palette for Modus Operandi with some
basic background values that apply to buffers and the mode line
(remember to inspect the actual value to find out all the associations
that can be overridden):

     (defconst modus-themes-operandi-colors
       '((bg-main . "#ffffff")
         (bg-dim . "#f8f8f8")
         (bg-alt . "#f0f0f0")
         (bg-active . "#d7d7d7")
         (bg-inactive . "#efefef")))

   As one can tell, we bind a key to a hexadecimal RGB color value.  Now
say we wish to override those specific values and have our changes
propagate to all faces that use those keys.  We could write something
like this, which adds a subtle ochre tint:

     (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides
           '((bg-main . "#fefcf4")
             (bg-dim . "#faf6ef")
             (bg-alt . "#f7efe5")
             (bg-active . "#e8dfd1")
             (bg-inactive . "#f6ece5")))

   Once this is evaluated, any subsequent loading of ‘modus-operandi’
will use those values instead of the defaults.  No further intervention
is required.

   To reset the changes, we apply this and reload the theme:

     (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil)

   Users who wish to leverage such a mechanism can opt to implement it
on-demand by means of a global minor mode.  The following snippet covers
both themes and expands to some more assosiations in the palette:

     (define-minor-mode my-modus-themes-tinted
       "Tweak some Modus themes colors."
       :init-value nil
       :global t
       (if my-modus-themes-tinted
           (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides
                 '((bg-main . "#fefcf4")
                   (bg-dim . "#faf6ef")
                   (bg-alt . "#f7efe5")
                   (bg-hl-line . "#f4f0e3")
                   (bg-active . "#e8dfd1")
                   (bg-inactive . "#f6ece5")
                   (bg-region . "#c6bab1")
                   (bg-header . "#ede3e0")
                   (bg-tab-bar . "#dcd3d3")
                   (bg-tab-active . "#fdf6eb")
                   (bg-tab-inactive . "#c8bab8")
                   (fg-unfocused . "#55556f"))
                 modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides
                 '((bg-main . "#100b17")
                   (bg-dim . "#161129")
                   (bg-alt . "#181732")
                   (bg-hl-line . "#191628")
                   (bg-active . "#282e46")
                   (bg-inactive . "#1a1e39")
                   (bg-region . "#393a53")
                   (bg-header . "#202037")
                   (bg-tab-bar . "#262b41")
                   (bg-tab-active . "#120f18")
                   (bg-tab-inactive . "#3a3a5a")
                   (fg-unfocused . "#9a9aab")))
         (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil
               modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides nil)))

   With this in place, one can invoke ‘M-x my-modus-themes-tinted’ and
then load the Modus theme of their choice.  The new palette subset will
come into effect: subtle ochre tints for Modus Operandi and night sky
shades for Modus Vivendi.  Switching between the two themes, such as
with ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’ will also use the overrides.

   Given that this is a user-level customisation, one is free to
implement whatever color values they desire, even if the possible
combinations fall below the minimum 7:1 contrast ratio that governs the
design of the themes (the WCAG AAA legibility standard).  Alternatively,
this can also be done programmatically (*note Override color saturation:
Override color saturation (DIY).).

   For manual interventions it is advised to inspect the source code of
‘modus-themes-operandi-colors’ and ‘modus-themes-vivendi-colors’ for the
inline commentary: it explains what the intended use of each palette
subset is.

   Furthermore, users may benefit from the ‘modus-themes-contrast’
function that we provide: *note test color combinations: Measure color
contrast (DIY). It measures the contrast ratio between two color values,
so it can help in overriding the palette (or a subset thereof) without
making the end result inaccessible.

5.7 Override color saturation (DIY)
===================================

In the previous section we documented how one can override color values
manually (*note Override colors: Override colors (DIY).). Here we use a
programmatic approach which leverages the built-in ‘color-saturate-name’
function to adjust the saturation of all color values used by the active
Modus theme.  Our goal is to prepare a counterpart of the active theme’s
palette that holds modified color values, adjusted for a percent change
in saturation.  A positive number amplifies the effect, while a negative
one will move towards a grayscale spectrum.

   We start with a function that can be either called from Lisp or
invoked interactively.  In the former scenario, we pass to it the rate
of change we want.  While in the latter, a minibuffer prompt asks for a
number to apply the desired effect.  In either case, we intend to assign
anew the value of ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’ (light theme)
and the same for ‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’ (dark theme).

     (defun my-modus-themes-saturate (percent)
       "Saturate current Modus theme palette overrides by PERCENT."
       (interactive
        (list (read-number "Saturation by percent: ")))
       (let* ((theme (modus-themes--current-theme))
              (palette (pcase theme
                         ('modus-operandi modus-themes-operandi-colors)
                         ('modus-vivendi modus-themes-vivendi-colors)
                         (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (overrides (pcase theme
                           ('modus-operandi 'modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides)
                           ('modus-vivendi 'modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides)
                           (_ (error "No Modus theme is active")))))
         (let (name cons colors)
           (dolist (cons palette)
             (setq name (color-saturate-name (cdr cons) percent))
             (setq name (format "%s" name))
             (setq cons `(,(car cons) . ,name))
             (push cons colors))
           (set overrides colors))
         (pcase theme
           ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
           ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi)))))

     ;; sample Elisp calls (or call `my-modus-themes-saturate' interactively)
     (my-modus-themes-saturate 50)
     (my-modus-themes-saturate -75)

   Using the above has an immediate effect, as it reloads the active
Modus theme.

   The ‘my-modus-themes-saturate’ function stores new color values in
the variables ‘modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides’ and
‘modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides’, meaning that it undoes changes
implemented by the user on individual colors.  To have both automatic
saturation adjustment across the board and retain per-case edits to the
palette, some tweaks to the above function are required.  For example:

     (defvar my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides
       '((fg-main . "#ead0c0")
         (bg-main . "#050515"))
       "My bespoke colors for `modus-vivendi'.")

     (defvar my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides
       '((fg-main . "#1a1a1a")
         (bg-main . "#fefcf4"))
       "My bespoke colors for `modus-operandi'.")

     (defun my-modus-themes-saturate (percent)
       "Saturate current Modus theme palette overrides by PERCENT.
     Preserve the color values stored in
     `my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides',
     `my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides'."
       (interactive
        (list (read-number "Saturation by percent: ")))
       (let* ((theme (modus-themes--current-theme))
              (palette (pcase theme
                         ('modus-operandi modus-themes-operandi-colors)
                         ('modus-vivendi modus-themes-vivendi-colors)
                         (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (overrides (pcase theme
                           ('modus-operandi 'modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides)
                           ('modus-vivendi 'modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides)
                           (_ (error "No Modus theme is active"))))
              (extra-overrides (pcase theme
                                 ('modus-operandi my-modus-themes-operandi-extra-color-overrides)
                                 ('modus-vivendi my-modus-themes-vivendi-extra-color-overrides)
                                 (_ (error "No Modus theme is active")))))
         (let (name cons colors)
           (dolist (cons palette)
             (setq name (color-saturate-name (cdr cons) percent))
             (setq name (format "%s" name))
             (setq cons `(,(car cons) . ,name))
             (push cons colors))
           (set overrides (append extra-overrides colors)))
         (pcase theme
           ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
           ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi)))))

   To disable the effect, one must reset the aforementioned variables of
the themes to ‘nil’.  Or specify a command for it, such as by taking
inspiration from the ‘modus-themes-toggle’ we already provide:

     (defun my-modus-themes-revert-overrides ()
       "Reset palette overrides and reload active Modus theme."
       (interactive)
       (setq modus-themes-operandi-color-overrides nil
             modus-themes-vivendi-color-overrides nil)
       (pcase (modus-themes--current-theme)
         ('modus-operandi (modus-themes-load-operandi))
         ('modus-vivendi (modus-themes-load-vivendi))))

5.8 Font configurations for Org and others (DIY)
================================================

The themes are designed to cope well with mixed font configurations.

   *note Option for no font mixing: No mixed fonts.

   This mostly concerns ‘org-mode’ and ‘markdown-mode’, though expect to
find it elsewhere like in ‘Info-mode’.

   In practice it means that the user can safely opt for a more
prose-friendly proportionately spaced typeface as their default, while
letting spacing-sensitive elements like tables and inline code always
use a monospaced font, by inheriting from the ‘fixed-pitch’ face.

   Users can try the built-in ‘M-x variable-pitch-mode’ to see the
effect in action.

   To make everything use your desired font families, you need to
configure the ‘variable-pitch’ (proportional spacing) and ‘fixed-pitch’
(monospaced) faces respectively.  It may also be convenient to set your
main typeface by configuring the ‘default’ face the same way.

   Put something like this in your initialization file (also consider
reading the doc string of ‘set-face-attribute’):

     ;; Main typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 110)

     ;; Proportionately spaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Serif" :height 1.0)

     ;; Monospaced typeface
     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 1.0)

   Note the differences in the ‘:height’ property.  The ‘default’ face
must specify an absolute value, which is the point size × 10.  So if you
want to use a font at point size ‘11’, you set the height to ‘110’.(1)
Whereas every other face must have a value that is relative to the
default, represented as a floating point (if you use an integer, then
that means an absolute height).  This is of paramount importance: it
ensures that all fonts can scale gracefully when using something like
the ‘text-scale-adjust’ command which only operates on the base font
size (i.e.  the ‘default’ face’s absolute height).

   *note Note for EWW and Elfeed fonts (SHR fonts): Note on EWW and
Elfeed fonts (SHR fonts).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) ‘:height’ values do not need to be rounded to multiples of ten:
the likes of ‘115’ are perfectly valid—some typefaces will change to
account for those finer increments.

5.9 Custom Org user faces (DIY)
===============================

Users of ‘org-mode’ have the option to configure various keywords and
priority cookies to better match their workflow.  User options are
‘org-todo-keyword-faces’ and ‘org-priority-faces’.

   As those are meant to be custom faces, it is futile to have the
themes guess what each user wants to use, which keywords to target, and
so on.  Instead, we can provide guidelines on how to customize things to
one’s liking with the intent of retaining the overall aesthetic of the
themes.

   Please bear in mind that the end result of those is not controlled by
the active Modus theme but by how Org maps faces to its constructs.
Editing those while ‘org-mode’ is active requires re-initialization of
the mode with ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.

   Let us assume you wish to visually differentiate your keywords.  You
have something like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(D)" "CANCEL(C)")
             (sequence "MEET(m)" "|" "MET(M)")
             (sequence "STUDY(s)" "|" "STUDIED(S)")
             (sequence "WRITE(w)" "|" "WROTE(W)")))

   You could then use a variant of the following to inherit from a face
that uses the styles you want and also to preserve the properties
applied by the ‘org-todo’ face:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . '(font-lock-preprocessor-face org-todo))
             ("STUDY" . '(font-lock-variable-name-face org-todo))
             ("WRITE" . '(font-lock-type-face org-todo))))

   This will refashion the keywords you specify, while letting the other
items in ‘org-todo-keywords’ use their original styles (which are
defined in the ‘org-todo’ and ‘org-done’ faces).

   If you want back the defaults, try specifying just the ‘org-todo’
face:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("MEET" . org-todo)
             ("STUDY" . org-todo)
             ("WRITE" . org-todo)))

   When you inherit from multiple faces, you need to quote the list as
shown further above.  The order is important: the last item is applied
over the previous ones.  If you do not want to blend multiple faces, you
do not need a quoted list.  A pattern of ‘keyword . face’ will suffice.

   Both approaches can be used simultaneously, as illustrated in this
configuration of the priority cookies:

     (setq org-priority-faces
           '((?A . '(org-scheduled-today org-priority))
             (?B . org-priority)
             (?C . '(shadow org-priority))))

   To find all the faces that are loaded in your current Emacs session,
use ‘M-x list-faces-display’.  Try ‘M-x describe-variable’ as well and
then specify the name of each of those Org variables demonstrated above.
Their documentation strings will offer you further guidance.

   Recall that the themes let you retrieve a color from their palette.
Do it if you plan to control face attributes.

5.10 Update Org block delimiter fontification (DIY)
===================================================

As noted in the section about ‘modus-themes-org-blocks’, Org contains a
variable that determines whether the block’s begin and end lines are
extended to the edge of the window (*note Option for org-mode block
styles: Org mode blocks.).  The variable is
‘org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line’.

   Users who change the style of Org blocks from time to time may prefer
to automatically update delimiter line fontification, such as with the
following setup:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil)))

     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook
               #'my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines)

   Then ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect, though manual
intervention can be circumvented by tweaking the function thus:

     (defun my-modus-themes-org-fontify-block-delimiter-lines ()
       "Match `org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line' to theme style.
     Run this function at the post theme load phase, such as with the
     `modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook'."
       (if (eq modus-themes-org-blocks 'gray-background)
           (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t)
         (setq org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line nil))
       (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
         (font-lock-flush)))

5.11 Measure color contrast (DIY)
=================================

The themes provide the functions ‘modus-themes-wcag-formula’ and
‘modus-themes-contrast’.  The former is a direct implementation of the
WCAG formula: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html>.  It
calculates the relative luminance of a color value that is expressed in
hexadecimal RGB notation.  While the latter function is just a
convenient wrapper for comparing the relative luminance between two
colors.

   In practice, one needs to work only with ‘modus-themes-contrast’.  It
accepts two color values and returns their contrast ratio.  Values range
from 1 to 21 (lowest to highest).  The themes are designed to always be
equal or higher than 7 for each combination of background and foreground
that they use (this is the WCAG AAA standard—the most demanding of its
kind).

   A couple of examples (rounded numbers):

     ;; Pure white with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#ffffff" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 1.37
     ;; That is an outright inaccessible combo

     ;; Pure black with pure green
     (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00")
     ;; => 15.3
     ;; That is is a highly accessible combo

   It does not matter which color value comes first.  The ratio is
always the same.

   If one does not wish to read all the decimal points, it is possible
to try something like this:

     (format "%0.2f" (modus-themes-contrast "#000000" "#00ff00"))

   While it is fine to perform such calculations on a case-by-case
basis, it is preferable to implement formulas and tables for more
demanding tasks.  Such instruments are provided by ‘org-mode’ or
‘orgtbl-mode’, both of which are built into Emacs.  Below is such a
table that derives the contrast ratio of all colors in the first column
(pure red, green, blue) relative to the color specified in the first row
of the second column (pure white) and rounds the results:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |
     | #00ff00 |    1.37 |
     | #0000ff |    8.59 |
     #+tblfm: $2='(modus-themes-contrast $1 @1$2);%0.2f

   To measure color contrast one needs to start from a known value.
This typically is the background.  The Modus themes define an expanded
palette in large part because certain colors are only meant to be used
in combination with some others.  Consult the source code for the
minutia and relevant commentary.

   Such knowledge may prove valuable while attempting to override some
of the themes’ colors: *note Override colors: Override colors (DIY).

5.12 Load theme depending on time of day (DIY)
==============================================

While we do provide ‘modus-themes-toggle’ to manually switch between the
themes, users may also set up their system to perform such a task
automatically at sunrise and sunset.

   This can be accomplished by specifying the coordinates of one’s
location using the built-in ‘solar.el’ and then configuring the
‘circadian’ package:

     (use-package solar                      ; built-in
       :config
       (setq calendar-latitude 35.17
             calendar-longitude 33.36))

     (use-package circadian                  ; you need to install this
       :ensure
       :after solar
       (setq circadian-themes '((:sunrise . modus-operandi)
                                (:sunset  . modus-vivendi)))
       (circadian-setup))

5.13 Backdrop for pdf-tools (DIY)
=================================

Most PDF files use a white background for their page, making it
impossible to discern the file’s boundaries in the buffer while using
the Modus Operandi theme.  To introduce a distinction between the
buffer’s backdrop and the PDF page’s background, the former must be
rendered as some shade of gray.  Ideally, ‘pdf-tools’ would provide a
face that the themes could support directly, though this does not seem
to be the case for the time being.  We must thus employ the face
remapping technique that is documented elsewhere in this document to
change the buffer-local value of the ‘default’ face.

   *note Remap face with local value (DIY)::.

   To remap the buffer’s backdrop, we start with a function like this
one:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'default
        `(:background ,(modus-themes-color 'bg-alt))))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-backdrop)

   The idea is to assign that function to a hook that gets called when
‘pdf-tools’ renders the document: ‘pdf-tools-enabled-hook’.  This is
enough when you only use one theme.  However it has the downside of
setting the background color value only at render time.  In other words,
the face remapping function does not get evaluated anew whenever the
theme changes, such as upon invoking ‘M-x modus-themes-toggle’.

   To have our face remapping adapt gracefully while switching between
the Modus themes, we need to also account for the current theme and
control the activation of ‘pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode’.  To which end
we arrive at something like the following, which builds on the above
example:

     (defun my-pdf-tools-backdrop ()
       (face-remap-add-relative
        'default
        `(:background ,(modus-themes-color 'bg-alt))))

     (defun my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle ()
       (when (derived-mode-p 'pdf-view-mode)
         (if (eq (car custom-enabled-themes) 'modus-vivendi)
             (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode 1)
           (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode -1))
         (my-pdf-tools-backdrop)))

     (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook #'my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)
     (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'my-pdf-tools-midnight-mode-toggle)

   With those in place, PDFs have a distinct backdrop for their page,
while they automatically switch to their dark mode when
‘modus-themes-toggle’ is called from inside a buffer whose major-mode is
‘pdf-view-mode’.

5.14 A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading (DIY)
==================================================

The themes are designed with the intent to be useful to Emacs users of
varying skill levels, from beginners to experts.  This means that we try
to make things easier by not expecting anyone reading this document to
be proficient in Emacs Lisp or programming in general.

   Such a case is with the use of the
‘modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook’, which runs after
‘modus-themes-toggle’, ‘modus-themes-load-operandi’, or
‘modus-themes-load-vivendi’ is evaluated.  We recommend using that hook
for advanced customizations, because (1) we know for sure that it is
available once the themes are loaded, and (2) anyone consulting this
manual, especially the sections on enabling and loading the themes, will
be in a good position to benefit from that hook.

   Advanced users who have a need to switch between the Modus themes and
other items will find that such a hook does not meet their requirements:
it only works with the Modus themes and only with the aforementioned
functions.

   A theme-agnostic setup can be configured thus:

     (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil
        "Normal hook run after enabling a theme.")

     (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args)
        "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'."
        (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook))

     (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook)

   This creates the ‘after-enable-theme-hook’ and makes it run after
each call to ‘enable-theme’, which means that it will work for all
themes and also has the benefit that it does not depend on functions
such as ‘modus-themes-toggle’ and the others mentioned above.
‘enable-theme’ is called internally by ‘load-theme’, so the hook works
everywhere.

   Now this specific piece of Elisp may be simple for experienced users,
but it is not easy to read for newcomers, including the author of the
Modus themes for the first several months of their time as an Emacs
user.  Hence our hesitation to recommend it as part of the standard
setup of the Modus themes (it is generally a good idea to understand
what the implications are of advising a function).

7.1 Note on inline Latex in Org buffers
=======================================

Org can work with inline latex and related syntax.  To actually fontify
those constructs, set the variable ‘org-highlight-latex-and-related’ to
the desired list of values (per its doc string).  For example:

     (setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex script))

   Remember to use ‘M-x org-mode-restart’ for changes to take effect.

7.2 Note on dimmer.el
=====================

The ‘dimmer.el’ library by Neil Okamoto can be configured to
automatically dim the colors of inactive Emacs windows.  To guarantee
consistent results with the Modus themes, we suggest some tweaks to the
default styles, such as in this minimal setup:

     (use-package dimmer
       :config
       (setq dimmer-fraction 0.3)
       (setq dimmer-adjustment-mode :foreground)
       (setq dimmer-use-colorspace :rgb)

       (dimmer-mode 1))

   Of the above, we strongly recommend the RGB color space because it is
the one that remains faithful to the hueness of the colors used by the
themes.  Whereas the default CIELAB space has a tendency to distort
colors in addition to applying the dim effect, which can be somewhat
disorienting.

   The value of the ‘dimmer-fraction’ has been selected empirically.
Users might prefer to tweak it further (increasing it makes the dim
effect more pronounced).

   Changing the ‘dimmer-adjustment-mode’ is a matter of preference.
Though because the Modus themes use black and white as their base
colors, any other value for that variable will turn the main background
gray.  This inadvertently leads to the opposite of the intended utility
of this package: it draws too much attention to unfocused windows.


File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode,  Next: Note on mmm-modeel background colors,  Prev: Note on dimmerel,  Up: Notes on individual packages

7.3 Note on display-fill-column-indicator-mode
==============================================

While designing the style for ‘display-fill-column-indicator-mode’, we
stayed close to the mode’s defaults: to apply a subtle foreground color
to the ‘fill-column-indicator’ face, which blends well with the rest of
theme and is consistent with the role of that mode.  This is to not
upset the expectations of users.

   Nevertheless, ‘display-fill-column-indicator-mode’ has some known
limitations pertaining to its choice of using typographic characters to
draw its indicator.  What should be a continuous vertical line might
appear as a series of dashes in certain contexts or under specific
conditions: a non-default value for ‘line-spacing’, scaled and/or
variable-pitch headings have been observed to cause this effect.

   Given that we cannot control such factors, it may be better for
affected users to deviate from the default style of the
‘fill-column-indicator’ face.  Instead of setting a foreground color,
one could use a background and have the foreground be indistinguishable
from it.  For example:

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(fill-column-indicator ((,class :background ,bg-inactive
                                         :foreground ,bg-inactive)))))

scale using the themes' palette (DIY).

7.4 Note on mmm-mode.el background colors
=========================================

The faces used by ‘mmm-mode.el’ are expected to have a colorful
background, while they should not touch any foreground value.  The idea
is that they must not interfere with existing fontification.  Those
background colors need to be distinct from each other, such as an
unambiguous red juxtaposed with a clear blue.

   While this design may be internally consistent with the raison d’être
of that library, it inevitably produces inaccessible color combinations.

   There are two competing goals at play:

  1. Legibility of the text, understood as the contrast ratio between
     the background and the foreground.

  2. Semantic precision of each face which entails faithfulness to
     color-coding of the underlying background.

   As the Modus themes are designed with the express purpose of
conforming with the first point, we have to forgo the apparent
color-coding of the background elements.  Instead we use subtle colors
that do not undermine the legibility of the affected text while they
still offer a sense of added context.

   Users who might prefer to fall below the minimum 7:1 contrast ratio
in relative luminance (the accessibility target we conform with), can
opt to configure the relevant faces on their own.

   *note Face specs at scale using the themes’ palette: Face specs at
scale using the themes' palette (DIY).

   This example uses more vivid background colors, though it comes at
the very high cost of degraded legibility.

     (modus-themes-with-colors
       (custom-set-faces
        `(mmm-cleanup-submode-face ((,class :background ,yellow-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-code-submode-face ((,class :background ,bg-active)))
        `(mmm-comment-submode-face ((,class :background ,blue-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-declaration-submode-face ((,class :background ,cyan-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-default-submode-face ((,class :background ,bg-alt)))
        `(mmm-init-submode-face ((,class :background ,magenta-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-output-submode-face ((,class :background ,red-refine-bg)))
        `(mmm-special-submode-face ((,class :background ,green-refine-bg)))))

7.5 Note on prism.el
====================

This package by Adam Porter, aka “alphapapa” or “github-alphapapa”,
implements an alternative to the typical coloration of code.  Instead of
highlighting the syntactic constructs, it applies color to different
levels of depth in the code structure.

   As ‘prism.el’ offers a broad range of customisations, we cannot style
it directly at the theme level: that would run contrary to the spirit of
the package.  Instead, we may offer preset color schemes.  Those should
offer a starting point for users to adapt to their needs.

   In the following code snippets, we employ the
‘modus-themes-with-colors’ macro: *note Face specs at scale using the
themes’ palette: Face specs at scale using the themes' palette (DIY).

   These are the minimum recommended settings with 16 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 16)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main

                       fg-special-warm)))

   With 8 colors:

     (setq prism-num-faces 8)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-special-cold
                       magenta
                       magenta-alt-other
                       cyan-alt-other
                       fg-main
                       blue-alt
                       red-alt-other
                       cyan)))

   And this is with 4 colors, which produces results that are the
closest to the themes’ default aesthetic:

     (setq prism-num-faces 4)

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations '(0) ; do not change---may lower the contrast ratio
       :lightens '(0)      ; same
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       cyan-alt-other
                       magenta-alt-other
                       magenta)))

   If you need to apply desaturation and lightening, you can use what
the ‘prism.el’ documentation recommends, like this (adapting to the
examples with the 4, 8, 16 colors):

     (prism-set-colors
       :desaturations (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :lightens (cl-loop for i from 0 below 16 collect (* i 2.5))
       :colors (modus-themes-with-colors
                 (list fg-main
                       cyan-alt-other
                       magenta-alt-other
                       magenta)))

7.6 Note on god-mode.el
=======================

The ‘god-mode’ library does not provide faces that could be configured
by the Modus themes.  Users who would like to get some visual feedback
on the status of ‘M-x god-mode’ are instead encouraged by upstream to
set up their own configurations, such as by changing the ‘mode-line’
face (*note Advanced customization (do-it-yourself)::).  This is an
adaptation of the approach followed in the upstream README:

     (defun my-god-mode-update-mode-line ()
       "Make `mode-line' blue if God local mode is active."
       (modus-themes-with-colors
         (if god-local-mode
             (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil
                                 :foreground blue-active
                                 :background bg-active-accent
                                 :box blue)
           (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil
                               :foreground fg-active
                               :background bg-active
                               :box fg-alt))))

     (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'my-god-mode-update-mode-line)

   We employ the ‘modus-themes-with-colors’ which provides access to
color variables defined by the active theme.  Its use is covered
elsewhere in this manual (*note Face specs at scale using the themes’
palette: Face specs at scale using the themes' palette (DIY).). As for
the attributes that can be passed to each face, start by consulting the
documentation string of ‘set-face-attribute’.

7.7 Note on company-mode overlay pop-up
=======================================

By default, the ‘company-mode’ pop-up that lists completion candidates
is drawn using an overlay.  This creates alignment issues every time it
is placed above a piece of text that has a different height than the
default.

   The solution recommended by the project’s maintainer is to use an
alternative front-end for drawing the pop-up which draws child frames
instead of overlays.(1)(2)

7.8 Note on ERC escaped color sequences
=======================================

The built-in IRC client ‘erc’ has the ability to colorise any text using
escape sequences that start with ‘^C’ (inserted with ‘C-q C-c’) and are
followed by a number for the foreground and background.(1)  Possible
numbers are 0-15, with the first entry being the foreground and the
second the background, separated by a comma.  Like this ‘^C1,6’.  The
minimum setup is this:

     (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'irccontrols)
     (setq erc-interpret-controls-p t
           erc-interpret-mirc-color t)

   As this allows users the chance to make arbitrary combinations, it is
impossible to guarantee a consistently high contrast ratio.  All we can
we do is provide guidance on the combinations that satisfy the
accessibility standard of the themes:

Modus Operandi
     Use foreground color 1 for all backgrounds from 2-15.  Like so:
     ‘C-q C-c1’ where ‘N’ is the background.

Modus Vivendi
     Use foreground color 0 for all backgrounds from 2-13.  Use
     foreground ‘1’ for backgrounds 14, 15.

   Colors 0 and 1 are white and black respectively.  So combine them
together, if you must.

7.11 Note on EWW and Elfeed fonts (SHR fonts)
=============================================

EWW and Elfeed rely on the Simple HTML Renderer to display their
content.  The ‘shr.el’ library contains the variable ‘shr-use-fonts’
that controls whether the text in the buffer is set to a
‘variable-pitch’ typeface (proportionately spaced) or if just retains
whatever the default font family is.  Its default value is non-nil,
which means that ‘variable-pitch’ is applied.

7.12 Note on Helm grep
======================

There is one face from the Helm package that is meant to highlight the
matches of a grep or grep-like command (‘ag’ or ‘ripgrep’).  It is
‘helm-grep-match’.  However, this face can only apply when the user does
not pass ‘--color=always’ as a command-line option for their command.

   Here is the docstring for that face, which is defined in the
‘helm-grep.el’ library (you can always visit the source code with ‘M-x
find-library’).

     Face used to highlight grep matches.  Have no effect when grep
     backend use “–color=”

   The user must either remove ‘--color’ from the flags passed to the
grep function, or explicitly use ‘--color=never’ (or equivalent).  Helm
provides user-facing customization options for controlling the grep
function’s parameters, such as ‘helm-grep-default-command’ and
‘helm-grep-git-grep-command’.

   When ‘--color=always’ is in effect, the grep output will use red text
in bold letter forms to present the matching part in the list of
candidates.  That style still meets the contrast ratio target of >= 7:1
(accessibility standard WCAG AAA), because it draws the reference to
ANSI color number 1 (red) from the already-supported array of
‘ansi-color-names-vector’.

7.13 Note on vc-annotate-background-mode
========================================

Due to the unique way ‘vc-annotate’ (‘C-x v g’) applies colors, support
for its background mode (‘vc-annotate-background-mode’) is disabled at
the theme level.

   Normally, such a drastic measure should not belong in a theme:
assuming the user’s preferences is bad practice.  However, it has been
deemed necessary in the interest of preserving color contrast
accessibility while still supporting a useful built-in tool.

   If there actually is a way to avoid such a course of action, without
prejudice to the accessibility standard of this project, then please
report as much or send patches (*note Contributing::).

7.14 Note on pdf-tools link hints
=================================

Hints are drawn by ImageMagick (https://imagemagick.org/), not Emacs,
i.e., ImageMagick doesn’t know about the hint face unless you tell
ImageMagick about it.  By default, only the foreground and background
color attributes are passed.  The below snippet adds to those the
various font attributes.  As it queries various faces, specifically
‘pdf-links-read-link’ and the faces it inherits, it needs to be added to
your initialization file after you’ve customized any faces.

File: modus-themes.info,  Node: Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?,  Next: What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

8.1 Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?
================================================

The minimum contrast ratio in relative luminance that the themes conform
with always refers to any given combination of background and foreground
colors.  If we have some blue colored text next to a magenta one, both
against a white background, we do not mean to imply that blue:magenta is
7:1 in terms of relative luminance.  Rather, we state that blue:white
and magenta:white each are 7:1 or higher.

   The point of reference is always the background.  Because colors have
about the same minimum distance in luminance from their backdrop, they
necessarily are fairly close to each other in this measure.  A possible
blue:magenta combination would naturally be around 1:1 in contrast of
the sort here considered.

   To differentiate between sequential colors, we rely on hueness by
mapping contrasting hues to adjacent constructs, while avoiding
exaggerations.  A blue next to a magenta can be told apart regardless of
their respective contrast ratio against their common background.
Exceptions would be tiny characters in arguably not so realistic cases,
such as two dots drawn side-by-side which for some reason would need to
be colored differently.  They would still be legible though, which is
the primary objective of the Modus themes.

8.2 What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?
=============================================

The Modus themes are designed with restraint, so that their default
looks do not overdo it with the application of color.

   *note Customization Options::.

   This is the non-quantifiable aspect of the themes’ design: the
artistic part, if you will.  There are a lot of cases where color can be
used inconsiderately, without accounting for layout, typographic, or
other properties of the presentation.  For example, two headings with
distinct markers, such as leading asterisks in Org buffers, do not have
to have highly contrasting hues between them in order to be told apart:
the added element of contrast in hueness does not contribute
significantly more to the distinction between the headings than colors
whose hues are relatively closer to each other in the color space.

   Exaggerations can be hard to anticipate or identify.  Multiple shades
of blue and magenta in the same context may not seem optimal: one might
think that it would be better to use highly contrasting hues to ensure
that all colors stand out, such as by placing blue next to yellow, next
to magenta, and green.  That would, however, be a case of design for its
own sake; a case where color is being applied without consideration of
its end results in the given context.  Too many contrasting hues in
close proximity force an erratic rate to how the eye jumps from one
piece of text to the next.  Whereas multiple shades of, say, blue and
magenta can suffice to tell things apart and avoid excess coloration: a
harmonious rhythm.

8.3 Why are colors mostly variants of blue, magenta, cyan?
==========================================================

Due to the innate properties of color, some options are better than
others for the accessibility purposes of the themes, the stylistic
consistency between ‘modus-operandi’ and ‘modus-vivendi’, and the
avoidance of exaggerations in design.

   *note What does it mean to avoid exaggerations?::

   What we describe as color is a function of three distinct channels of
light: red, green, blue.  In hexadecimal RGB notation, a color value is
read as three pairs of red, green, and blue light: ‘#RRGGBB’.  Of those
three, the most luminant is green, while the least luminant is blue.

   The three basic colors represent each of the three channels of light.
They can be intermixed to give us six colors: red and green derive
yellow, green and blue make cyan, red and blue turn into magenta.

   We can test the luminance of each of those against white and black to
get a sense of how not all colors are equally good for accessibility
(white is ‘#ffffff’, which means that all three light channels are fully
luminated, while black is ‘#000000’ meaning that no light is present
(notwithstanding display technology)).

     | Name    |         | #ffffff | #000000 |
     |---------+---------+---------+---------|
     | red     | #ff0000 |    4.00 |    5.25 |
     | yellow  | #ffff00 |    1.07 |   19.56 |
     | green   | #00ff00 |    1.37 |   15.30 |
     | cyan    | #00ffff |    1.25 |   16.75 |
     | blue    | #0000ff |    8.59 |    2.44 |
     | magenta | #ff00ff |    3.14 |    6.70 |

   *note Measure color contrast: Measure color contrast (DIY).

   By reading this table we learn that every color that has a high level
of green light (green, yellow, cyan) is virtually unreadable against a
white background and, conversely, can be easily read against black.

   We can then infer that red and blue, in different combinations, with
green acting as calibrator for luminance, will give us fairly moderate
colors that pass the 7:1 target.  Blue with a bit of green produce
appropriate variants of cyan.  Similarly, blue combined with some red
and hints of green give us suitable shades of purple.

   Due to the need of maintaining some difference in hueness between
adjacent colors, it is not possible to make red, green, and yellow the
primary colors, because blue could not be used to control their
luminance and, thus the relevant space shrinks considerably.

   *note Is the contrast ratio about adjacent colors?::

   This phenomenon is best illustrated by the following table that
measures the relative luminance of shades of red, yellow, magenta
against white:

     |         | #ffffff |
     |---------+---------|
     | #990000 |    8.92 |
     | #995500 |    5.75 |
     | #990099 |    7.46 |

   We notice that equal values of red and blue light in ‘#990099’
(magenta shade) do not lead to a considerable change in luminance
compared with ‘#990000’ (red variant).  Whereas less amount of green
light in ‘#995500’ leads to a major drop in luminance relative to white.
It follows that using the green channel of light to calibrate the
luminance of colors is more effective than trying to do the same with
either red or blue (the latter is the least effective in that regard).

   When we need to work with several colors, it is always better to have
sufficient manoeuvring space, especially since we cannot pick arbitrary
colors but only those that satisfy the accessibility objectives of the
themes.

   As for why we do not mostly use green, yellow, cyan for the dark
theme, it is because those colors are far more luminant than their
counterparts on the other side of the spectrum, so to ensure that they
all have about the same contrast ratios we would have to alter their
hueness considerably.  In short, the effect would not be optimal as it
would lead to exaggerations.  Plus, it would make ‘modus-vivendi’ look
completely different than ‘modus-operandi’, to the effect that the two
could not be properly considered part of the same project.

8.4 What is the best setup for legibility?
==========================================

The Modus themes can be conceptually simplified as combinations of color
values that account for relative luminance and inner harmony.  Those
qualities do not guarantee that every end-user will have the same
experience, due to differences between people, but also because of
variances in hardware capabilities and configurations.  For the purposes
of this document, we may only provide suggestions pertaining to the
latter case.

   ‘modus-operandi’ is best used outdoors or in a room that either gets
direct sunlight or has plenty of light.  Whereas ‘modus-vivendi’ works
better when there is not a lot of sunshine or the room has a source of
light, preferably a faint or warm one.  It is possible to use
‘modus-operandi’ at night and ‘modus-vivendi’ during the day, though
that will depend on several variables, such as one’s overall perception
of color, the paint on the walls and how that contributes to the
impression of lightness in the room, the sense of space within the eye’s
peripheral vision, and environmental factors.

   In general, an additional source of light other than that of the
monitor can help reduce eye strain: the eyes are more relaxed when they
do not have to focus on one point to gather light.

   The monitor’s display settings must be accounted for.  Gamma ray
values, in particular, need to be calibrated to neither amplify nor
distort the perception of black.  Same principle for sharpness,
brightness, and contrast as determined by the hardware, which all have
an effect on how text is read on the screen.

   There are software level methods on offer, such as the XrandR utility
for the X Window System (X.org), which can make gamma corrections for
each of the three channels of light (red, green, blue).  For example:

     xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 1.0 --gamma 0.76:0.75:0.68

   Typography is another variable.  Some font families are blurry at
small point sizes.  Others may have a regular weight that is lighter
(thiner) than that of their peers which may, under certain
circumstances, cause a halo effect around each glyph.

   The gist is that legibility cannot be fully solved at the theme
level.  The color combinations may have been optimized for
accessibility, though the remaining contributing factors in each case
need to be considered in full.

interest of the latter.

9.3 Patches require copyright assignment to the FSF
===================================================

Code contributions are most welcome.  For any major edit (more than 15
lines, or so, in aggregate per person), you need to make a copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation.  This is necessary because
the themes are part of the upstream Emacs distribution: the FSF must at
all times be in a position to enforce the GNU General Public License.

   Copyright assignment is a simple process.  Check the request form
below (please adapt it accordingly).  You must write an email to the
address mentioned in the form and then wait for the FSF to send you a
legal agreement.  Sign the document and file it back to them.  This
could all happen via email and take about a week.  You are encouraged to
go through this process.  You only need to do it once.  It will allow
you to make contributions to Emacs in general.

     Please email the following information to assign@gnu.org, and we
     will send you the assignment form for your past and future changes.

     Please use your full legal name (in ASCII characters) as the subject
     line of the message.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     REQUEST: SEND FORM FOR PAST AND FUTURE CHANGES

     [What is the name of the program or package you're contributing to?]

     GNU Emacs

     [Did you copy any files or text written by someone else in these changes?
     Even if that material is free software, we need to know about it.]

     Copied a few snippets from the same files I edited.  Their author,
     Protesilaos Stavrou, has already assigned copyright to the Free Software
     Foundation.

     [Do you have an employer who might have a basis to claim to own
     your changes?  Do you attend a school which might make such a claim?]


     [For the copyright registration, what country are you a citizen of?]

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
